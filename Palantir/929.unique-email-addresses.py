# Testcase Example:  "[\"test.email+alex@leetcode.com\",\"test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com\",\"testemail+david@lee.tcode.com\"]"
#
# Every valid email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by
# the '@' sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more
# '.' or '+'.
#
# For example, in "alice@leetcode.com", "alice" is the local name, and
# "leetcode.com" is the domain name.
#
# If you add periods '.' between some characters in the local name part of an
# email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without
# dots in the local name. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.
#
# For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the
# same email address.
#
# If you add a plus '+' in the local name, everything after the first plus sign
# will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this
# rule does not apply to domain names.
#
# For example, "m.y+name@email.com" will be forwarded to "my@email.com".
#
# It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.
#
# Given an array of strings emails where we send one email to each emails[i],
# return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: emails =
# ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually
# receive mails.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: emails = ["a@leetcode.com","b@leetcode.com","c@leetcode.com"]
# Output: 3
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= emails.length <= 100
#
# 1 <= emails[i].length <= 100
#
# emails[i] consist of lowercase English letters, '+', '.' and '@'.
#
# Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character.
#
# All local and domain names are non-empty.
#
# Local names do not start with a '+' character.
#
# Domain names end with the ".com" suffix.
#
# Domain names must contain at least one character before ".com" suffix.

        Interview explanation:
        Normalize each address: ignore '.' in local, truncate local at '+',
        keep domain as-is; count unique normalized strings.

        Algorithm:
        - For each email: split local@domain; local = local.split('+')[0].replace('.','')
        - Add f"{local}@{domain}" to a set; return len(set)

        Complexity: O(N * L) time, O(N * L) space.
