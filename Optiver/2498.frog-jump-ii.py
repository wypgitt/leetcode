#
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array stones sorted in strictly increasing
# order representing the positions of stones in a river.
#
# A frog, initially on the first stone, wants to travel to the last stone and
# then return to the first stone. However, it can jump to any stone at most
# once.
#
# The length of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the
# stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog
# jumps.
#
#
# More formally, if the frog is at stones[i] and is jumping to stones[j], the
# length of the jump is |stones[i] - stones[j]|.
#
# The cost of a path is the maximum length of a jump among all jumps in the
# path.
#
# Return the minimum cost of a path for the frog.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: stones = [0,2,5,6,7]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The above figure represents one of the optimal paths the frog can
# take.
# The cost of this path is 5, which is the maximum length of a jump.
# Since it is not possible to achieve a cost of less than 5, we return it.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: stones = [0,3,9]
# Output: 9
# Explanation:
# The frog can jump directly to the last stone and come back to the first stone.
# In this case, the length of each jump will be 9. The cost for the path will be
# max(9, 9) = 9.
# It can be shown that this is the minimum achievable cost.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 2 <= stones.length <= 10^5
#
#
# 0 <= stones[i] <= 10^9
#
#
# stones[0] == 0
#
#
# stones is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

        Interview explanation:
        Frog jumps forward visiting each stone once then returns (except start/
        end). Minimize the max jump length of the path.

        Algorithm:
        - Optimal: jump every other stone forward and fill gaps on return;
          max jump is max(stones[i+2]-stones[i]) (and stones[1]-stones[0]).
