# Testcase Example:  "\"yz\""
#
#
# You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters.
#
# You can perform the following operation any number of times (including
# zero):
#
# Choose any character c in the string and replace every occurrence of c
# with the next lowercase letter in the English alphabet.
#
# Return the minimum number of operations required to transform s into a
# string consisting of only 'a' characters.
#
# Note: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus 'a' comes after 'z'.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "yz"
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
# Change 'y' to 'z' to get "zz".
#
# Change 'z' to 'a' to get "aa".
#
# Thus, the answer is 2.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "a"
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# The string "a" only consists of 'a'​​​​​​​ characters. Thus, the answer
# is 0.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5
#
# s consists only of lowercase English letters.

        Interview explanation:
        An operation advances every occurrence of a chosen letter by one in the
        alphabet (wrapping z→a). Letters only move forward together, so the
        answer is the farthest forward distance from any letter to 'a'.

        Algorithm:
        - For each distinct/non-'a' char c, need (ord('a') - ord(c)) % 26 ops
          along the chain.
        - Return the maximum of those distances (0 if s is all 'a's).

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.

        return max((ord("a") - ord(c)) % 26 for c in s)
