# Testcase Example:  "[5,4,3]"
#
#
# You are given an integer array nums of length n.
#
# An element at index i is called dominant if: nums[i] > average(nums[i +
# 1], nums[i + 2], ..., nums[n - 1])
#
# Your task is to count the number of indices i that are dominant.
#
# The average of a set of numbers is the value obtained by adding all the
# numbers together and dividing the sum by the total number of numbers.
#
# Note: The rightmost element of any array is not dominant.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [5,4,3]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
# At index i = 0, the value 5 is dominant as 5 > average(4, 3) = 3.5.
#
# At index i = 1, the value 4 is dominant over the subarray [3].
#
# Index i = 2 is not dominant as there are no elements to its right. Thus,
# the answer is 2.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [4,1,2]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
# At index i = 0, the value 4 is dominant over the subarray [1, 2].
#
# At index i = 1, the value 1 is not dominant.
#
# Index i = 2 is not dominant as there are no elements to its right. Thus,
# the answer is 1.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
#
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 100​​​​​​​

        Interview explanation:
        Count indices i where nums[i] strictly exceeds the average of the
        suffix to its right. The rightmost index is never dominant.

        Algorithm:
        - Walk right to left maintaining suffix sum and count.
        - For each i < n-1, check nums[i] * cnt > suffix_sum.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.
