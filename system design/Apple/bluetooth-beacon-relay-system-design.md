## 1. Clarify Requirements (Interview Q&A)

Goal: **bound beacon relay**—extend range of low-power beacons via phone relays without exposing user identity or draining battery.

### 1.0 Apple interview lens (say this early)

| Dimension | Apple-weighted expectation | Anti-pattern |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Privacy | Minimize server-visible PII; on-device processing first; retention & deletion are first-class | Logging raw content "for ML" without consent |
| Auth | Apple ID + device attestation; least-privilege tokens | Writable endpoints with guessable IDs |
| APIs | Versioned contracts; idempotency; clear error taxonomy | Chatty RPCs on cellular |
| Storage | Clear SoT; encryption at rest; sync tokens; conflict policy | Dual SoT without reconciliation |
| Offline | Local-first where required; queue + replay | Assume always-online |
| On-device / server | Explicit boundary: what never leaves device | Accidental cloud of secrets/health/raw content |

### 1.1 Functional Requirements

| # | Question to ask | Expected / typical interviewer answer | Design implication |
|---|-----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| F1 | Beacon? | Coin cell accessories | Slow adv |
| F2 | Relay? | Nearby phones forward | Opt-in OS feature |
| F3 | Privacy? | Rotating beacon IDs | No owner track relay phone |
| F4 | Payload? | Encrypted location/time | Owner decrypt |
| F5 | Duty cycle? | ms级 adv interval sparse | Battery months |
| F6 | Relay battery? | Batch uploads | Coalesce |
| F7 | Range? | Extend via mesh hops | One hop typical |
| F8 | Abuse? | Rate limits | Flooding filters |
| F9 | Lost item? | Owner fetch | Same as Find My |
| F10 | Android relay? | Out of MVP | Apple network |
| F11 | Indoor? | Coarse location | Wi‑Fi/BT fusion on relay phone |
| F12 | Firmware? | OTA signed | Accessory updates |

**MVP functional scope (lock with interviewer):**

1. Sparse BLE advertisements
2. Rotating public keys
3. Relay phone encrypted report upload
4. Owner-side decryption
5. Duty cycle enforcement
6. Batch relay uploads
7. TTL report store

**Out of MVP (explicitly defer):**

- Multi-hop mesh with guaranteed delivery
- Continuous high-rate tracking

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements

| # | Question | Expected answer | Target |
|---|----------|-----------------|--------|
| N1 | Beacon battery | 12+ months | µA average |
| N2 | Relay impact | < 1% daily phone battery | Batching |
| N3 | Privacy | No plaintext location server | E2E |
| N4 | Latency | Minutes | Crowd dependent |
| N5 | Scale | Billions sightings/day | Ingest shards |
| N6 | Integrity | Signed adv | Replay window |
| N7 | Durability | TTL hours-days | Not archive |
| N8 | Safety | Stalker alerts | On-device |

### 1.3 Cases (Flows & Edge Cases)

**Happy paths**

1. Beacon advertises → passerby phone uploads encrypted sighting → owner sees update
2. Sparse adv preserves battery
3. Relay batches 20 sightings one radio wake
4. Rotating keys prevent tracking beacon owner via fixed ID

**Edge / failure cases**

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| No relays rural | Stale last seen |
| Adv collision dense | Random backoff |
| Malicious relay flood | Rate cap |
| Beacon reset | New key enrollment |
| Phone offline | Delayed upload |
| Firmware bug | OTA rollback |
| Legal disable region | Geo policy |
| Tiny battery low | Reduce adv rate |

### 1.4 Scales (Progressive)

| Metric | Baseline | 10× | 100× | 1,000× |
|--------|----------|-----|------|--------|
| Beacons active | 200M | 500M | 1B | 2B |
| Sightings/day | 5B | 50B | 200B | 500B |
| Avg report | 180 B | 200 B | 220 B | 250 B |
| Relay phones | 500M | 1B | 2B | 3B |
| Adv interval sec | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Batch size | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 |
| TTL hours | 24 | 24 | 12 | 12 |
| OTA/day | 10K | 50K | 200K | 500K |

**What each jump forces:**

- **10×:** Ingest sharding
- **100×:** Geo TTL partitions
- **1,000×:** Adaptive adv schedules by crowd density

### 1.5 Etc. (Constraints & Assumptions)

- Coin cell power dominates design
- Same privacy bar as Find My

**Scope statement:**

> Design a low-power Bluetooth beacon relay network (Find My / accessory class): minimal duty cycle advertisements, encrypted uplink reports, relay phone batch uploads, privacy rotations, and strict battery budgets.

## 2. Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation

### 2.1 Daily volume

```text
Sighting reports operations: 5B/day × 200 B ≈ 1 TB/day
Avg payload: 180–250 B
Peak ≈ 3× peak average → size sharding + coalescing mandatory at 100×
```

### 2.2 Metadata vs payload split

```text
Control plane (cursors, acks, small envelopes) → high QPS, low bytes
Payload plane (blobs, attachments) → low QPS relative, high bytes
Battery cost often dominated by radio wake count, not raw MB
```

### 2.3 Per-device sync traffic

```text
Active device daily:
  - Pull: cursor fetch + N delta mutations (few MB typical)
  - Push: outbox flush batched every T seconds
  - Large transfers deferred to Wi‑Fi/charging unless user-initiated
```

### 2.4 Control-plane QPS sketch

```text
Users × active fraction × sync sessions/hour → session starts/s
Each session amplifies to metadata req/s
1000×: cells + push coalescing mandatory; no global poll
```

### 2.5 Storage steady state

```text
Delete-after-ack / compaction keeps steady-state ≪ daily write volume
Backlog during outage: hours × peak write rate → plan shard capacity
```

### 2.6 Energy model (qualitative)

```text
E_sync ≈ N_wakes × E_radio_spinup + bytes × E_tx
Minimize N_wakes via coalescing collapse_id / dirty batching
Defer large payloads when Low Power Mode && !charging
```

### 2.7 Unit-check traps

| Claim | Truth |
|-------|-------|
| Phone relays 24/7 scan | Duty capped |
| 5B × 1KB = 5PB/day | ~1 TB/day at 200B |

### 2.8 Critical bottlenecks (rank ordered)

1. Ingest QPS  
2. Relay phone battery if batching fails  
3. Beacon coin cell peak current  
4. Key rotation  
5. Owner fetch fanout

---

## 3. High-Level Design

### 3.1 Core abstractions

```text
BeaconAdv(rotating_pubkey, battery_status)
SightingReport(enc_location_time, beacon_key_id)
RelayBatch(reports[], relay_anon_id)
DutySchedule(interval, jitter)
```

### 3.2 On-device vs server split

| Concern | On-device (relay) | Server |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Location fix | Relay phone GPS/Wi‑Fi | Never plaintext |
| Upload | Batch when on network | Store encrypted |
| Beacon adv | Accessory firmware | — |
| Owner map | Owner decrypt | Serves blobs |

### 3.3 Options & trade-offs

| Option | Pros | Cons | Deal-breaker when |
|--------|------|------|-------------------|
| A. Fixed MAC beacon | Simple | Trackable | No |
| B. Rotating keys + encrypted relay | Private | Complex | — chosen |
| C. Continuous scanning phones | Fast | Battery death | No |
| D. Cellular in beacon | No relay | Power/cost | Tag size |

**Chosen path:** Sparse rotating BLE beacons with encrypted relay uploads batched on phones; owner decrypts; server blind.

### 3.4 Privacy, trust, and encryption

Rotating IDs; encrypted reports; relay phone doesn't know owner identity.

### 3.5 Consistency, sync, and conflict resolution

Sighting reports append-only TTL; owner merges timeline.

### 3.6 Offline-first behavior

Beacon still advertises; relay uploads later.

### 3.7 Battery, radio, and scheduling

Sparse adv; relay batching; phone duty caps.

### 3.8 Multi-region / cell model

Global ingest; geo TTL.

### 3.9 Abuse, auth, and quotas

Flood filters; stalker alerts.

### 3.10 Key invariants (state these explicitly)

1. **Local durability before UI ACK** for user-initiated writes.
2. **Cloud durability before local eviction** of the last copy of user data (where applicable).
3. **Idempotent apply** — replay of the same `op_id` / `mutation_id` / `message_id` is safe.
4. **Tombstones for delete** — never silently drop data without retention policy.
5. **Single-writer home cell** per user/library/device shard to avoid split brain.
6. **Battery-aware radio use** — coalesce wakes; defer large payloads on cellular/LPM unless user-visible.



### 3.11 Advanced Data Protection (ADP) fork

| Mode | Server sees | On-device responsibility |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| ADP / E2E on | Ciphertext blobs + opaque sync envelopes | Decrypt, merge, ML, search |
| Standard protection | May allow richer server-side features | Still minimize retention; disclose trade-off |

**Interview win:** Offer both modes; do not claim server plaintext AI/derivatives while ADP E2E holds.

Beacon ~~BLE~~> Relay iPhone --batch encrypted--> Ingest
                                              ↓
Owner iPhone fetch decrypt map
Duty cycle keeps coin cell alive months
```

---

## 5. Design Deep Dive

### 5.1 Reliability & durability invariants

1. Local durable write before UI ACK for user mutations in **Low-Power Bluetooth Beacon Relay**.
2. Cloud durable ACK before local eviction of last copy (where applicable).
3. Idempotent apply by `mutation_id` / `message_id` / `op_id`.
4. Tombstones for deletes; never silent drop.

| Failure | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| App kill mid-sync | Resume from outbox/cursor |
| Home cell outage | Local continues; queue; epoch fence on failover |
| Bitrot | AEAD + checksums end-to-end |
| Push loss | Pull reconcile on next wake |
| Dual-writer split brain | Single-writer home cell per `beacon_id` |

### 5.2 Scalability & sharding

```text
beacon_id → home_cell (consistent hash / directory)
Encrypted sighting reports partitioned by beacon_id
Hot entities → dedicated shards / rate limits
```

| Scale | Change |
|-------|--------|
| 1× | Monolithic log + object store |
| 10× | Cell directory; push coalescing |
| 100× | Regional placement; compaction/snapshots |
| 1000× | Hierarchical cursors; cold tiers; strict radio budgets |

### 5.3 Maintainability & schema evolution

- Version mutation/envelope schema (`schema_v`, `op_type`).
- Additive fields only for old clients.
- Feature flags per account for new semantics.
- Observability: sizes, latencies, error codes—not plaintext **Low-Power Bluetooth Beacon Relay** content.

### 5.4 Conflict resolution walk-through

**Example 1 — concurrent edits offline:**
```text
Device A: set field X @ lamport 5
Device B: set field X @ lamport 6 → B wins (LWW)
Equal lamport → tie-break device_id
```

**Example 2 — delete vs edit:**
```text
Delete tombstone causally after last edit → hidden everywhere
Edit after delete within retention → restore/quarantine UX
```

**Example 3 — set membership:**
```text
OR-set add-wins; remove via tagged tombstone
```

### 5.5 Battery-conscious sync behavior

| Lever | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Coalesce | Batch mutations; min interval between radio wakes |
| Defer | Large blobs on Wi‑Fi + charging unless user-visible |
| Adaptive parallelism | 1 stream cellular; N on Wi‑Fi |
| Budget | OS background energy integration |
| Push not poll | Dirty-bit wakes; reconcile pull |

### 5.6 Security & privacy checklist

- TLS 1.3; pinning where appropriate.
- Secure Enclave for key material.
- AEAD for sensitive payloads; AAD binds entity ids.
- Server authz: device session touches only owned entities.
- Rate limits on fetch to mitigate account takeover exfil.
- E2E mode: server stores ciphertext only; no plaintext derivatives.

### 5.7 Observability without spying

| Metric OK | Metric NOT OK |
|-----------|----------------|
| Cursor lag, upload success | Message/note/health body text |
| Part retry counts | Raw attachment bytes logged |
| Battery energy samples | Decrypted field values |
| Error codes / sizes | GPS plaintext under E2E |

### 5.8 Progressive scale operations

```text
Baseline: single region, per-user home cell
10×: shard mailboxes/logs; APNs coalescer fleet
100×: regional blob placement; snapshot baselines for far-behind clients
1000×: hierarchical cursors; admission control; cold storage tiers
```

## 6. Wrap-Up

### 6.1 What we designed

Low-power beacon relay: sparse rotating BLE, encrypted sighting batches from relay phones, owner decryption, strict duty cycles for tag and phone battery.

### 6.2 Top trade-offs

| Trade-off | Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Adv rate vs find speed | Sparse default | Battery |

## 7. Deeper / Related Interview Questions

### 7.1 Privacy & on-device split

**Q: What must never leave the device plaintext in Low-Power Bluetooth Beacon Relay?**  
A: User content and sensitive metadata under E2E/ADP-style modes; server should see ciphertext or anonymized aggregates only.

**Q: How do you explain on-device vs server to the interviewer?**  
A: Client owns encrypt/decrypt, conflict apply, and battery scheduling; server owns durable ordering, fan-out, and blob storage of opaque bytes.

**Q: Can support engineers read user data?**  
A: Not under E2E. Recovery/escrow is an explicit product mode with UX—not a silent backdoor.

### 7.2 Offline & conflicts

**Q: What happens after a week offline?**  
A: Local writes accumulate in an outbox; on reconnect, catch-up via cursor/snapshot; conflicts resolve with documented LWW/CRDT/merge rules.

**Q: How do you avoid silent data loss?**  
A: Local durability before ACK to UI; cloud durable ACK before eviction; idempotent mutation ids; tombstones for deletes.

**Q: Clock skew?**  
A: Do not trust wall clocks alone—use server_seq / lamport / vector clocks as appropriate.

### 7.3 Battery & networking

**Q: Why coalesce sync wakes?**  
A: Radio spin-up dominates energy; batch mutations and use push dirty-bits instead of polling.

**Q: Cellular vs Wi-Fi policy?**  
A: Default: metadata/small on cellular; large blobs on Wi-Fi/charging unless user overrides.

**Q: Low Power Mode?**  
A: Defer background transfers; keep user-initiated paths snappy.

### 7.4 Scale & cells

**Q: Why home cell / single-writer?**  
A: Avoid dual-writer split brain for a user's sync log or mailbox.

**Q: What breaks at 1000× if you keep one Postgres?**  
A: Write QPS, heartbeat/sync chatty paths, and noisy neighbors—must shard by user/library/device.

**Q: How do you shape thundering herds?**  
A: Jitter, coalescing, admission control, snapshot baselines for far-behind clients.

### 7.5 Reliability drills

**Q: Kill app mid-upload/sync?**  
A: Resume with idempotent sessions; fencing tokens if leases exist.

**Q: Home cell failover?**  
A: Epoch fence old primary; expect at-least-once replay; clients idempotent.

**Q: Corruption / bitrot?**  
A: Checksums end-to-end; AEAD tags; re-fetch or re-upload parts.

### 7.6 Interview traps

**Q: Claiming E2E while server generates plaintext derivatives**  
A: Contradiction—call it out.

**Q: Evicting local data before cloud ACK**  
A: Data-loss bug.

**Q: Polling every few seconds forever**  
A: Battery death.

**Q: Unit errors (PB vs TB)**  
A: Always show arithmetic.

### 7.7 Comparison & differentiation

**Q: How is Low-Power Bluetooth Beacon Relay different from generic cloud file sync?**  
A: Apple products need explicit on-device vs server boundaries, E2E/ADP modes, battery-aware schedulers, and conflict policies—not just S3 + Postgres.

**Q: How does this compare to Google/Dropbox approach?**  
A: Stress on-device processing, minimal server retention, and user-visible privacy modes without disparaging competitors.

**Q: What would you cut if the interview is 30 minutes?**  
A: Defer extreme scale (1,000×), sharing ACLs, web clients, and federated/ML paths—keep local-first + encryption + sync + conflicts.

### 7.8 Operational drills

**Q: How do you test battery impact?**  
A: Instruments energy trace; count radio wakes; verify coalescing under bursty mutations; compare against baseline budget.

**Q: How do you test conflict correctness?**  
A: Dual-device sim offline edits; property tests on merge; never assert silent data loss.

**Q: What metrics alert on-call without violating privacy?**  
A: Cursor lag, upload failure rate, chunk retries, push wake counts—never body text or decrypted fields.

| Offline | Outbox + durable local DB | Airplane mode |
| Scale unit | user/library/device shard | Single-writer |

### 8.7 Open questions for interviewer

1. Is Advanced Data Protection / E2E required or optional for Low-Power Bluetooth Beacon Relay?
2. Exact conflict UX when automatic merge is ambiguous?
3. Web/browser clients in scope?
4. Cross-user sharing / family features in MVP?
5. Retention / legal hold constraints?

### 8.11 API sketch (interview whiteboard)

```text
POST /v1/sync/push        batch encrypted mutations (idempotent op_ids)
GET  /v1/sync/pull        ?cursor=&limit=   returns ops + server_seq
POST /v1/blobs/session    resumable upload (parts + complete)
GET  /v1/blobs/{ref}/part fetch ciphertext part (authz)
POST /v1/devices/register key directory / push token
DELETE /v1/devices/{id}   revoke + stop fan-out
GET  /v1/snapshot         optional baseline for far-behind clients
```
All payloads: TLS + device session auth; sensitive fields ciphertext client-side.

### 8.12 Schema sketches (generic)

```text
-- device local
local_records(id, payload, updated_lamport, deleted_at)
outbox(op_id, envelope_enc, created_at)
cursors(shard_id, last_applied_seq)

-- server (home cell)
sync_log(entity_id, server_seq, op_id, envelope_enc, device_id, ts)
blobs(ref, entity_id, size, checksum, storage_class)
upload_sessions(id, entity_id, state, parts_json)
tombstones(entity_id, id, seq, purge_after)
devices(user_id, device_id, keys, push_token, revoked_at)
```

### 8.13 Compaction & snapshot algorithm

```text
periodically per entity shard:
  S = fold(sync_log[1..N]) into encrypted snapshot blob
  publish snapshot@S for cold clients
  retain sync_log (S-W, ∞] for lagging cursors
  GC older ops when all device cursors > S-W (grace period)
```

### 8.14 Priority scoring (scheduler reference)

```text
score = w1*user_visible + w2*small_payload + w3*age_hours
        - w4*cellular_cost - w5*battery_penalty - w6*thermal_penalty
defer if Low Power && !charging && !user_visible
boost user-initiated open/share/export paths immediately
```

### 8.15 Client sync agent pseudocode

```text
loop:
  wait(push_dirty OR timer OR user_action OR battery_ok_window)
  if not network_allowed(): continue
  push_outbox_batch(limit=K)
  pull_since(cursor, limit=K)
  apply_idempotent(mutations)
  ack_cursor()
  maybe_compact_local()
```

### 8.16 Home-cell failover note

```text
epoch++
fence old primary writes
clients retry with backoff
in-flight ops idempotent by mutation_id
expect at-least-once delivery of sync ops
```

### 8.17 What "done" looks like in 45 minutes

- Clear MVP scope  
- Correct trust boundary (on-device vs server)  
- One coherent diagram  
- Conflict resolution example  
- Scale + battery paragraph  
- Honest non-goals  

### 8.18 Cellular / Wi‑Fi policy matrix

| Condition | Metadata sync | Small payloads | Large blobs |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Wi‑Fi | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cellular default | Yes | Recent/small | Defer |
| Cellular + user allow | Yes | Yes | Budget-capped |
| Low Power Mode | Coalesce | Defer | Defer |
| Charging + Wi‑Fi | Max throughput | Max | Max |

### 8.19 Interview traps (expanded)

| Trap | Pushback |
|------|----------|
| Server reads user content under E2E claim | Contradiction—call ADP/E2E fork |
| Evict local before cloud ACK | Data-loss bug |
| Poll every few seconds | Battery death |
| Dual active writers without merge | Split brain |
| Unit errors (PB vs TB) | Show arithmetic always |
| "We'll add privacy later" | Apple bar: privacy-first architecture |
