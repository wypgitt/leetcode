## 1. Clarify Requirements (Interview Q&A)

Goal: design a TripAdvisor-style system for places, user reviews/ratings/photos, aggregation, search/browse, and abuse moderation at progressive scale.

### 1.0 What this is / is not

| Dimension | This doc | Not this |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Job | Places + reviews + ratings UX | Full rides marketplace |
| Truth | Place & review SoR + aggregates | Google Maps tile stack deep |
| Uber lens | Geo discovery + trust/abuse | Pure social network |
| Money | Optional sponsored placements later | Payments core |

### 1.1 Functional Requirements

| # | Question to ask | Expected / typical interviewer answer | Design implication |
|---|-----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| F1 | Places? | CRUD/import POI | Place service |
| F2 | Reviews? | Text+rating+photos | Review service |
| F3 | Aggregates? | Avg rating, histogram | Materialized |
| F4 | Search? | Name/geo/category | Search index |
| F5 | Sort? | relevance, rating, distance | Rankers |
| F6 | Abuse? | spam/fake reviews | Moderation |
| F7 | Photos? | Upload + CDN | Media pipeline |
| F8 | Helpful votes? | Yes | Counters |
| F9 | Owner responses? | Claimed businesses | Roles |
| F10 | Freshness? | New reviews soon | Async index |
| F11 | Dedupe places? | Merge candidates | Entity resolution |
| F12 | Privacy? | User profiles limited | Settings |

**MVP functional scope (lock with interviewer):**

1. Place pages with geo/category attributes.
2. Create review with 1–5 rating + text; optional photos.
3. Aggregate rating counts; show average.
4. Geo/category browse + text search.
5. Basic spam signals + report + hide.
6. CDN for photos; virus scan hook.
7. Idempotent review create; edit/delete policy.

**Out of MVP (explicitly defer):**

- Full flights/hotels booking engine
- Perfect global entity resolution

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements

| # | Question | Expected answer | Target |
|---|----------|-----------------|--------|
| N1 | Read latency | Place page | p99 <200ms |
| N2 | Write visibility | Review appears | < seconds–minute |
| N3 | Trust | Fake review resistance | moderation SLOs |
| N4 | Scale reads | Celebrity places | cache |
| N5 | Geo query | Nearby places | index |
| N6 | Media | Photo upload | async process |
| N7 | Consistency | Aggregates EC OK | eventual |
| N8 | Availability | Reads degrade | cached aggregates |

### 1.3 Cases (Flows & Edge Cases)

**Happy paths**

1. User reviews restaurant → aggregate updates → appears in place page.
2. Nearby search returns places sorted by distance/rating.
3. Photo upload processed to derivatives on CDN.
4. Owner responds to review.
5. Report spam → moderator hides → aggregate recomputes.

**Edge / failure cases**

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Review bomb | rate limits + trust score |
| Duplicate places | merge tool |
| Edit rating thrash | cooldown / history |
| Huge place read volume | cache + shard aggregates |
| Offensive photo | async moderation |
| Deleted user | tombstone policy |
| Geographic spam farms | device/graph signals |
| Empty new city | import POI seed |

### 1.4 Scales (Progressive)

| Metric | Baseline | 10× | 100× | 1,000× |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Places | 5M | 50M | 500M | 1B+ |
| Reviews/day | 1M | 10M | 100M | 1B |
| Read QPS | 20K | 200K | 2M | edge |
| Photos/day | 2M | 20M | 200M | tiered |
| Cities | 1K | 10K | global | global |

**What each jump forces:**

- **10×:** Cache place pages; shard reviews by place_id
- **100×:** Search clusters; media pipeline; moderation ML
- **1,000×:** Edge CDN pages; hierarchical geo; strict abuse graph

### 1.5 Etc. (Constraints & Assumptions)

- Design for retries, idempotency, and city/region isolation.
- Fail closed on authz/money; degrade intentionally on non-critical paths.
- Peak ≠ average; stadium/airport spikes are first-class.
- Ratings are 1–5 stars; aggregates are counts not float sums only.
- Search index is a projection; Place DB is SoR.

**Scope statement:**

> Places + reviews/ratings/photos with aggregates, geo/text search, CDN media, and abuse moderation—from MVP city to global POI scale.

---

## 2. Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation

### Reads

```text
Celebrity place 50K QPS → cache heavily; origin shard
```

### Reviews

```text
10M/day × 2KB ≈ 20GB/day text+meta
```

### Photos

```text
20M/day × 200KB raw ≈ 4PB/day unrealistic—compress/derivatives/TTL policies
```

### Bottlenecks (rank ordered)

1. Hot place pages
2. Aggregate write contention
3. Search index lag
4. Fake review rings
5. Media cost
6. Merge POI conflicts

---

## 3. High-Level Design

### 3.1 Core abstractions

```text
Place
Review
RatingAggregate
PhotoAsset
ModerationCase
PlaceIndexDoc
```

### 3.2 Options & trade-offs

| Option | Pros | Cons | Deal-breaker when |
|--------|------|------|-------------------|
| A. Monolith SQL counts on read | Simple | Hot places die | Viral POI |
| B. Sync update aggregate in review TX | Consistent | Contention | Hot write |
| C. Review SoR + async aggregate + cache + search projection | Scales | Brief lag | — chosen |
| D. All in search engine | Flexible | Weak SoR | Disputes |

**Chosen path:**

- Place/Review DB SoR; outbox → aggregate updater + search indexer + moderation.
- Place page cache with short TTL + invalidate on review events.

### 3.3 Core design mechanics

**Write review:** validate → persist → outbox ReviewCreated → (agg increment, index, mod score).

**Aggregate:** counts[star] ++; avg = weighted; version++.

**Invariant:** One active review per (user, place) in MVP; aggregates derived; moderation can tombstone.

### 3.4 API sketch

```text
GET /v1/places/{id}
GET /v1/places/nearby?lat&lng&category
GET /v1/places/search?q
POST /v1/places/{id}/reviews {rating, text, photo_ids}
POST /v1/reviews/{id}/helpful
POST /v1/reviews/{id}/report
POST /v1/photos (multipart) → photo_id
```

### 3.5 Trade-offs summary

| Decision | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|
| Async aggregates | Scale vs brief stale avg |
| Strict one review/user | Trust vs flexibility |
| ML moderation | Recall vs false positives |
| CDN cache HTML/JSON | Perf vs freshness |

## 4. Architecture Diagram

```text
Apps → API → Place/Review Service → DB
                     | outbox
                     +→ Aggregate workers
                     +→ Search indexer
                     +→ Moderation
                     +→ Media variants → CDN
Cache/CDN ← place page reads
```

---

## 5. Design Deep Dive

### 5.1 Reliability

- Idempotent review ids.
- Aggregate rebuild from events.
- Moderation undo.
- Photo scan before public.

**Delivery / consistency cheat-sheet**

| Layer | Guarantee |
|-------|-----------|
| Client → API | At-least-once; idempotency keys where mutations exist |
| System of record | Single-writer per entity / partition key |
| Downstream effects | At-least-once via outbox/stream; idempotent consumers |
| Reads | Read-your-writes on primary; replicas may lag |

**Deal-breakers**

- Untrusted averages easy to bomb
- Hot place row lock on every review
- Search as only SoR

### 5.2 Scalability

- Shard reviews by place_id; cache hot places; edge; geo shards for nearby; media tiered storage.

**Progressive evolution**

| Scale | Architecture posture |
|-------|----------------------|
| Baseline | Single region/city; simple durable store + stream |
| 10× | Shard by city/entity; split hot paths |
| 100× | Cells, async fan-out, careful caching, hot-key splits |
| 1,000× | Hierarchical aggregation, edge where safe, strict cost/isolation |

### 5.3 Maintainability

- Aggregation golden tests; ranking eval sets; moderation audit logs.

- Versioned schemas/configs with rollback.
- Golden fixtures and replay tools for disputes/regressions.
- Published ownership boundaries between services.
- SLOs tied to user-visible failures; load-test stadium/airport peaks.

### 5.4 Multi-region clarity

| Plane | Mode |
|-------|------|
| Edge / API gateways | Active-active |
| Mutable entity writes | Home cell / city region single-writer |
| Caches / projections | Regional, eventually consistent |
| Analytics | Async lake / warehouse |

### 5.5 Security, privacy, abuse

- Authz on write; spam graph; PII in photos stripped/GPS scrub option; rate limits.

---

## 6. Wrap-Up

**What to say in 60 seconds**

> TripAdvisor-style design keeps Place/Review as SoR, updates rating aggregates and search via outbox events, caches hot place pages, runs media through CDN, and fights fake reviews with rate limits, diversity, and moderation—not with synchronous global locks.

**MVP → next**

1. MVP: invariants + audit/outbox + single-city correctness.
2. Next: sharding, richer consumers, degradation playbooks.
3. Later: edge optimizations, hierarchical aggregation, advanced models with caps.

**Top risks**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Hot keys / stadiums | Split shards, jitter, admission control |
| Retry storms | Idempotency, client jitter, coalescing |
| Inconsistent side effects | Outbox + consumer idempotency |
| Cost explosion | Sampling, TTL, tiered storage |
| Trust / correctness bugs | Audit, clamps, kill switches |

## 7. Deeper / Related Interview Questions

### Aggregates

**Q: Exact avg under race?**  
A: Event-sourced counts with periodic reconcile.

### Abuse

**Q: Review bomb?**  
A: Velocity, graph clustering, verified visit signals (if available).

### Scale & multi-region

**Q: How do you shard?**  
A: City/region cell first, then hash entity id within the cell.

**Q: Active-active writes for the same entity?**  
A: Avoid; home-cell single-writer with fencing on failover.

**Q: What do you shed first under load?**  
A: Non-critical analytics/marketing; protect money, safety, and trip-critical paths.

### Interview arithmetic / trap questions

**Q: When do units go wrong?**  
A: Mixing MB/GB/PB; using average instead of peak; forgetting retries amplify QPS; storing forever without sampling.

**Q: What do you defer explicitly?**  
A: Active-active multi-writer; perfect exactly-once for arbitrary side effects; unbounded history in primary OLTP.

**Q: What is the system of record?**  
A: Name it aloud—everything else is a projection/cache.

## 8. Appendices

### 8.1 Aggregate

```json
{"n":120,"stars":{"1":2,"2":3,"3":10,"4":40,"5":65},"avg":4.36,"ver":9}
```

### 8.2 SLOs

| SLO | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Place read p99 | <200ms |

*End of tripadvisor-like places & reviews system design.*

### Additional operational notes

- Page on SLO burn, not on every transient blip; use multi-window burn rates.
- Separate **user-facing errors** from **dependency noise** in dashboards.
- Keep a per-city feature flag for emergency degradations.
- Document ownership: on-call, codeowners, escalation path.
- Every external callback needs authentication and replay protection.
- Prefer additive schema changes; use explicit version fields on events.
- Load tests should include retry amplification (clients with 3× retries).
- Stadium and airport topologies are mandatory soak scenarios.
- Archive policy must be tested via restore drills, not only backups.
- When in doubt in interview: state invariant, then mechanism, then trade-off.

### Capacity planning worksheet (fill in interview)

```text
peak_qps = avg_qps × peak_factor (often 3–10×)
headroom = 1.5–2× peak for shard imbalance
storage_hot = entities_active × bytes × retention_hot
storage_cold = events_day × bytes × retention_cold × sample_rate
network = qps × payload × fanout
timers_or_connections = concurrent_sessions × cost_each
```

Challenge your own numbers: if storage becomes PB/month, you missed sampling/TTL.

### Failure mode & effects analysis (excerpt)

| Failure | User impact | Detection | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Primary store brownout | Elevated latency / writes fail | p99 + error rate | Shed non-critical; failover |
| Stream lag | Stale projections | Consumer lag SLO | Autoscale; pause non-critical |
| Bad config push | Wrong business behavior | Canaries / golden trips | Instant rollback |
| Hot key | Localized timeouts | Shard QPS skew | Split key; admission |
| Dependency timeout | Cascade | Dependency budgets | Circuit breaker + fallback |
| Clock skew | Wrong expiries | Skew metrics | Server time authority |

### Consistency patterns cheat-sheet

| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| CAS / version column | Single-row state transitions |
| Idempotency key store | Client retries |
| Outbox | DB + message atomicity |
| Lease + fencing token | Ownership of work |
| Single-writer shard / actor | Entity mutations |
| Quorum read/write | When multi-replica truth needed |
| Event-time + watermarks | Streaming windows |

### Interview narrative tips (Uber-flavored)

1. Start with marketplace entities and SLAs (freshness, money, safety).
2. Draw the **write path** first, then reads/projections.
3. Call out **geo locality** early for mobility problems.
4. Separate **control plane** (config, experiments) from **data plane**.
5. For money: minor units, idempotency, audit, reconciliation.
6. For realtime: define freshness with a number.
7. For 1000×: talk cells, hierarchical aggregation, cost budgets.
8. End with risks + kill switches.

- Separate **user-facing errors** from **dependency noise** in dashboards.
- Keep a per-city feature flag for emergency degradations.
- Document ownership: on-call, codeowners, escalation path.
- Every external callback needs authentication and replay protection.
- Prefer additive schema changes; use explicit version fields on events.
- Load tests should include retry amplification (clients with 3× retries).
- Stadium and airport topologies are mandatory soak scenarios.
- Archive policy must be tested via restore drills, not only backups.
- When in doubt in interview: state invariant, then mechanism, then trade-off.

### Capacity planning worksheet (fill in interview)

```text
peak_qps = avg_qps × peak_factor (often 3–10×)
headroom = 1.5–2× peak for shard imbalance
storage_hot = entities_active × bytes × retention_hot
storage_cold = events_day × bytes × retention_cold × sample_rate
network = qps × payload × fanout
timers_or_connections = concurrent_sessions × cost_each
```

Challenge your own numbers: if storage becomes PB/month, you missed sampling/TTL.
