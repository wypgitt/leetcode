## 1. Clarify Requirements (Interview Q&A)

Goal: design a search engine covering polite crawling, inverted indexing, query serving with cheap→expensive ranking, sharding, and freshness—usable for web or large document corpora in Uber interviews.

### 1.0 What this is / is not

| Dimension | This doc | Not this |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Job | Crawl + index + query | Full ads marketplace |
| Truth | Doc store + index segments | Browser rendering engine deep |
| Uber lens | Scale/sharding/freshness trade-offs | IR paper only |
| Corpus | Web or docs/help/POI text | Only SQL LIKE |

### 1.1 Functional Requirements

| # | Question to ask | Expected / typical interviewer answer | Design implication |
|---|-----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| F1 | Crawl? | Frontier + fetch + parse | Politeness |
| F2 | Index? | Inverted postings | Segments |
| F3 | Query? | AND/OR/phrase basic | Query service |
| F4 | Rank? | BM25 + static quality | Ranker |
| F5 | Freshness? | Recrawl schedule | Priority |
| F6 | Spell? | Suggest optional | Dict |
| F7 | Safe? | Filter | Classifier |
| F8 | Snippet? | Yes | Offsets |
| F9 | Delete? | Tombstone | GC |
| F10 | Sharding? | Term or doc | Plan |
| F11 | Multi-language? | Analyzers | Per locale |
| F12 | Metrics? | Latency/quality | Logs |

**MVP functional scope (lock with interviewer):**

1. URL frontier with per-host rate limits + robots.txt.
2. Fetcher/parser → document store.
3. Batch/nearline inverted index segments with postings lists.
4. Query API: tokenize → retrieve → BM25 top-k → snippets.
5. Tombstones for deletes; periodic merge.
6. Cache hot queries; timeouts.

**Out of MVP (explicitly defer):**

- Full web-scale knowledge graph
- Neural-only retrieval without lexical baseline

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements

| # | Question | Expected answer | Target |
|---|----------|-----------------|--------|
| N1 | Query p99 | Interactive | <100–200ms |
| N2 | Crawl politeness | No bans | per-host limits |
| N3 | Freshness | Important pages | hours–days |
| N4 | Availability | Replica shards | RF |
| N5 | Quality | Offline nDCG | eval sets |
| N6 | Spam | Demote | signals |
| N7 | Scale docs | See table | shards |
| N8 | Cost | Index size | compression |

### 1.3 Cases (Flows & Edge Cases)

**Happy paths**

1. Crawl discovers URL → index → query returns doc with snippet.
2. Update page recrawled → new segment overrides.
3. Hot query cached.
4. Safe filter removes disallowed.
5. Spell suggest corrects typo.

**Edge / failure cases**

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Hot term postings huge | split / skip lists |
| Site infinite calendar URLs | crawl budgets / canonical |
| Query all stopwords | reject/special |
| Deep pagination | cursor not huge offsets |
| Duplicate content | fingerprint cluster |
| JavaScript-heavy pages | MVP limited; render farm later |
| Index lag after delete | tombstone first |
| Shard failover | replicas |

### 1.4 Scales (Progressive)

| Metric | Baseline | 10× | 100× | 1,000× |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Documents | 100M | 1B | 10B | 100B |
| Query QPS | 5K | 50K | 500K | edge |
| Crawl pages/s | 1K | 10K | 100K | budgeted |
| Index size | 10TB | 100TB | 1PB | multi |
| Shards | 32 | 320 | 3K | cells |

**What each jump forces:**

- **10×:** Segmented index; query cache; host politeness
- **100×:** Federated term shards; tiered docs; spam
- **1,000×:** Hybrid ANN+lexical; geo cells of index; strict crawl budget

### 1.5 Etc. (Constraints & Assumptions)

- Design for retries, idempotency, and city/region isolation.
- Fail closed on authz/money; degrade intentionally on non-critical paths.
- Peak ≠ average; stadium/airport spikes are first-class.
- Analyzers are language-specific; start with one locale MVP.
- Exact phrase and BM25 enough before neural rerank.

**Scope statement:**

> Polite crawler, doc store, inverted index segments, sharded query serving with BM25+static quality, snippets, caches, tombstones—from 100M to multi-billion docs.

---

## 2. Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation

### Index

```text
1B docs × 5KB text → raw 5PB; index ~0.3–1× with compression—plan carefully
```

### Query

```text
50K qps with 10ms budget/shard fanout needs pruning
```

### Crawl

```text
10K pages/s × 50KB ≈ 500MB/s fetch
```

### Bottlenecks (rank ordered)

1. Hot terms
2. Fanout AND queries
3. Crawl traps
4. Merge CPU
5. Snippet IO
6. Spam/junk

---

## 3. High-Level Design

### 3.1 Core abstractions

```text
URLFrontier
Document
PostingList
IndexSegment
QueryPlan
RankedHit
```

### 3.2 Options & trade-offs

| Option | Pros | Cons | Deal-breaker when |
|--------|------|------|-------------------|
| A. SQL full-text only | Easy | Scale/quality | Web scale |
| B. Single-node Lucene | MVP | HA/scale | 100× |
| C. Distributed crawl + segment index + federated query | Scales | Ops | — chosen |
| D. Neural-only vectors | Semantic | Precision/cost/ops | Without lexical |

**Chosen path:**

- Distributed polite crawler → doc store → immutable index segments (Lucene-like) sharded → query broker fans out with top-k heap merge → cache.
- Optional L2 neural rerank later.

### 3.3 Core design mechanics

**Index:** tokenize doc → append postings → flush segment → publish → searcher opens.

**Query:** analyze → plan → fetch postings (skip lists) → cheap score heap → rerank topN → snippet.

**Invariant:** deletes tombstoned; robots obeyed; query fanout bounded.

### 3.4 API sketch

```text
GET /v1/search?q&limit&cursor&safe=
GET /v1/suggest?q=
POST /internal/index/batch
POST /internal/crawl/enqueue {urls[]}
DELETE /internal/documents?url=
```

### 3.5 Trade-offs summary

| Decision | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|
| Term vs doc sharding | Hot terms vs merge complexity |
| BM25 vs neural | Explainability vs quality |
| Batch vs incremental index | Freshness vs cost |
| Cache results | Hit rate vs staleness |

## 4. Architecture Diagram

```text
URL Frontier → Crawlers → Parser → Doc store → Indexer → Segments
Query API → Tokenizer → Shard routers → Postings → Heap merge → Rank → Snippets
Cache hot queries | Spell/Safe side paths | Analytics logs
```

## 5. Design Deep Dive

### 5.1 Reliability

- Robots compliance.
- Idempotent index by checksum.
- Query timeouts; max terms.
- Segment immutability + replicas.

**Delivery / consistency cheat-sheet**

| Layer | Guarantee |
|-------|-----------|
| Client → API | At-least-once; idempotency keys where mutations exist |
| System of record | Single-writer per entity / partition key |
| Downstream effects | At-least-once via outbox/stream; idempotent consumers |
| Reads | Read-your-writes on primary; replicas may lag |

**Deal-breakers**

- Unbounded wildcards
- No crawl rate limits
- Deep offset pagination into millions
- Index as only copy of content

### 5.2 Scalability

- Term-hash shards with federated top-k; cache head queries; tiered SSD/HDD; hybrid ANN later.

**Progressive evolution**

| Scale | Architecture posture |
|-------|----------------------|
| Baseline | Single region/city; simple durable store + stream |
| 10× | Shard by city/entity; split hot paths |
| 100× | Cells, async fan-out, careful caching, hot-key splits |
| 1,000× | Hierarchical aggregation, edge where safe, strict cost/isolation |

### 5.3 Maintainability

- Ranking eval harness; segment versioning; crawl budget configs.

- Versioned schemas/configs with rollback.
- Golden fixtures and replay tools for disputes/regressions.
- Published ownership boundaries between services.
- SLOs tied to user-visible failures; load-test stadium/airport peaks.

### 5.4 Multi-region clarity

| Plane | Mode |
|-------|------|
| Edge / API gateways | Active-active |
| Mutable entity writes | Home cell / city region single-writer |
| Caches / projections | Regional, eventually consistent |
| Analytics | Async lake / warehouse |

### 5.5 Security, privacy, abuse

- Safe search; ACL for private corpora; audit deletes; crawler credentials vault.

## 6. Wrap-Up

**What to say in 60 seconds**

> Search engine = polite crawler + doc store + inverted index segments + query broker with cheap→expensive ranking and snippets—sharded, cached, tombstoned deletes, explicit freshness/cost budgets.

**MVP → next**

1. MVP: invariants + audit/outbox + single-city correctness.
2. Next: sharding, richer consumers, degradation playbooks.
3. Later: edge optimizations, hierarchical aggregation, advanced models with caps.

**Top risks**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Hot keys / stadiums | Split shards, jitter, admission control |
| Retry storms | Idempotency, client jitter, coalescing |
| Inconsistent side effects | Outbox + consumer idempotency |
| Cost explosion | Sampling, TTL, tiered storage |
| Trust / correctness bugs | Audit, clamps, kill switches |

## 7. Deeper / Related Interview Questions

### Ranking

**Q: BM25?**  
A: TF saturation + IDF + length norm.

**Q: Hot term?**  
A: Split postings; parallel merge heap.

### Crawl

**Q: Avoid bans?**  
A: Per-host tokens; robots; budgets; backoff.

### Scale & multi-region

**Q: How do you shard?**  
A: City/region cell first, then hash entity id within the cell.

**Q: Active-active writes for the same entity?**  
A: Avoid; home-cell single-writer with fencing on failover.

**Q: What do you shed first under load?**  
A: Non-critical analytics/marketing; protect money, safety, and trip-critical paths.

### Interview arithmetic / trap questions

**Q: When do units go wrong?**  
A: Mixing MB/GB/PB; using average instead of peak; forgetting retries amplify QPS; storing forever without sampling.

**Q: What do you defer explicitly?**  
A: Active-active multi-writer; perfect exactly-once for arbitrary side effects; unbounded history in primary OLTP.

**Q: What is the system of record?**  
A: Name it aloud—everything else is a projection/cache.

### Additional operational notes

- Page on SLO burn, not on every transient blip; use multi-window burn rates.
- Separate **user-facing errors** from **dependency noise** in dashboards.
- Keep a per-city feature flag for emergency degradations.
- Document ownership: on-call, codeowners, escalation path.
- Every external callback needs authentication and replay protection.
- Prefer additive schema changes; use explicit version fields on events.
- Load tests should include retry amplification (clients with 3× retries).
- Stadium and airport topologies are mandatory soak scenarios.
- Archive policy must be tested via restore drills, not only backups.
- When in doubt in interview: state invariant, then mechanism, then trade-off.

### Capacity planning worksheet (fill in interview)

```text
peak_qps = avg_qps × peak_factor (often 3–10×)
headroom = 1.5–2× peak for shard imbalance
storage_hot = entities_active × bytes × retention_hot
storage_cold = events_day × bytes × retention_cold × sample_rate
network = qps × payload × fanout
timers_or_connections = concurrent_sessions × cost_each
```

Challenge your own numbers: if storage becomes PB/month, you missed sampling/TTL.

### Failure mode & effects analysis (excerpt)

| Failure | User impact | Detection | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Primary store brownout | Elevated latency / writes fail | p99 + error rate | Shed non-critical; failover |
| Stream lag | Stale projections | Consumer lag SLO | Autoscale; pause non-critical |
| Bad config push | Wrong business behavior | Canaries / golden trips | Instant rollback |
| Hot key | Localized timeouts | Shard QPS skew | Split key; admission |
| Dependency timeout | Cascade | Dependency budgets | Circuit breaker + fallback |
| Clock skew | Wrong expiries | Skew metrics | Server time authority |

### Consistency patterns cheat-sheet

| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| CAS / version column | Single-row state transitions |
| Idempotency key store | Client retries |
| Outbox | DB + message atomicity |
| Lease + fencing token | Ownership of work |
| Single-writer shard / actor | Entity mutations |
| Quorum read/write | When multi-replica truth needed |
| Event-time + watermarks | Streaming windows |

### Interview narrative tips (Uber-flavored)

1. Start with marketplace entities and SLAs (freshness, money, safety).
2. Draw the **write path** first, then reads/projections.
3. Call out **geo locality** early for mobility problems.
4. Separate **control plane** (config, experiments) from **data plane**.
5. For money: minor units, idempotency, audit, reconciliation.
6. For realtime: define freshness with a number.
7. For 1000×: talk cells, hierarchical aggregation, cost budgets.
8. End with risks + kill switches.

- Archive policy must be tested via restore drills, not only backups.
- When in doubt in interview: state invariant, then mechanism, then trade-off.

### Capacity planning worksheet (fill in interview)

```text
peak_qps = avg_qps × peak_factor (often 3–10×)
headroom = 1.5–2× peak for shard imbalance
storage_hot = entities_active × bytes × retention_hot
storage_cold = events_day × bytes × retention_cold × sample_rate
network = qps × payload × fanout
timers_or_connections = concurrent_sessions × cost_each
```

Challenge your own numbers: if storage becomes PB/month, you missed sampling/TTL.
