#
# You are given an integer array ribbons, where ribbons[i] represents the
# length of the i^th ribbon, and an integer k. You may cut any of the
# ribbons into any number of segments of positive integer lengths, or
# perform no cuts at all.
#
# For example, if you have a ribbon of length 4, you can:
#
# Keep the ribbon of length 4,
#
# Cut it into one ribbon of length 3 and one ribbon of length 1,
#
# Cut it into two ribbons of length 2,
#
# Cut it into one ribbon of length 2 and two ribbons of length 1, or
#
# Cut it into four ribbons of length 1.
#
# Your task is to determine the maximum length of ribbon, x, that allows
# you to cut at least k ribbons, each of length x. You can discard any
# leftover ribbon from the cuts. If it is impossible to cut k ribbons of
# the same length, return 0.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: ribbons = [9,7,5], k = 3
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# - Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length
# 4.
# - Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of
# length 2.
# - Keep the third ribbon as it is.
# Now you have 3 ribbons of length 5.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: ribbons = [7,5,9], k = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# - Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length
# 3.
# - Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of
# length 1.
# - Cut the third ribbon to three ribbons, two of length 4 and one of
# length 1.
# Now you have 4 ribbons of length 4.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: ribbons = [5,7,9], k = 22
# Output: 0
# Explanation: You cannot obtain k ribbons of the same positive integer
# length.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= ribbons.length <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= ribbons[i] <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= k <= 10^9

        Interview explanation:
        Premium: cut ribbons into k pieces of equal integer length x (waste OK).
        Maximize x, or 0 if impossible.

        Algorithm (binary search on answer):
        - lo=1, hi=max(ribbons). mid feasible if sum(r//mid) >= k.
        - Maximize feasible mid.

        Complexity: O(n log L) time, O(1) space.
