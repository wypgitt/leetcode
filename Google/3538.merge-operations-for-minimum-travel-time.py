#
#
# You are given a straight road of length l km, an integer n, an integer
# k, and two integer arrays, position and time, each of length n.
#
# The array position lists the positions (in km) of signs in strictly
# increasing order (with position[0] = 0 and position[n - 1] = l).
#
# Each time[i] represents the time (in minutes) required to travel 1 km
# between position[i] and position[i + 1].
#
# You must perform exactly k merge operations. In one merge, you can
# choose any two adjacent signs at indices i and i + 1 (with i > 0 and i +
# 1 < n) and:
#
# Update the sign at index i + 1 so that its time becomes time[i] + time[i
# + 1].
#
# Remove the sign at index i.
#
# Return the minimum total travel time (in minutes) to travel from 0 to l
# after exactly k merges.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: l = 10, n = 4, k = 1, position = [0,3,8,10], time = [5,8,3,6]
#
# Output: 62
#
# Explanation:
#
# Merge the signs at indices 1 and 2. Remove the sign at index 1, and
# change the time at index 2 to 8 + 3 = 11.
#
# After the merge:
#
# position array: [0, 8, 10]
#
# time array: [5, 11, 6]
#
#                                 Segment
#                                 Distance (km)
#                                 Time per km (min)
#                                 Segment Travel Time (min)
#
#                                 0 → 8
#                                 8
#                                 5
#                                 8 × 5 = 40
#
#                                 8 → 10
#                                 2
#                                 11
#                                 2 × 11 = 22
#
# Total Travel Time: 40 + 22 = 62, which is the minimum possible time
# after exactly 1 merge.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: l = 5, n = 5, k = 1, position = [0,1,2,3,5], time = [8,3,9,3,3]
#
# Output: 34
#
# Explanation:
#
# Merge the signs at indices 1 and 2. Remove the sign at index 1, and
# change the time at index 2 to 3 + 9 = 12.
#
# After the merge:
#
# position array: [0, 2, 3, 5]
#
# time array: [8, 12, 3, 3]
#
#                                 Segment
#                                 Distance (km)
#                                 Time per km (min)
#                                 Segment Travel Time (min)
#
#                                 0 → 2
#                                 2
#                                 8
#                                 2 × 8 = 16
#
#                                 2 → 3
#                                 1
#                                 12
#                                 1 × 12 = 12
#
#                                 3 → 5
#                                 2
#                                 3
#                                 2 × 3 = 6
#
# Total Travel Time: 16 + 12 + 6 = 34, which is the minimum possible time
# after exactly 1 merge.

        Interview explanation:
        Exactly k merges remove k intermediate signs; times of removed signs flow
        right into the next kept sign. DP over current sign, remaining merges, and
        the start of the rate-sum window.

        Algorithm:
        - prefix sums of time for O(1) rate = sum(time[last..i]).
        - dp(i, skips, last): min time from i to end with `skips` merges left.
        - Jump to j in (i, i+skips+1], paying (pos[j]-pos[i])*rate.

        Complexity: O(k^2 n^2) time, O(k n^2) memo space.
