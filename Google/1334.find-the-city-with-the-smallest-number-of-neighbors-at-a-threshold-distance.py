# There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where
# edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i] represents a bidirectional and weighted
# edge between cities from_i and to_i, and given the integer distanceThreshold.
#
# Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through
# some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold, If there are
# multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.
#
# Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the
# sum of the edges' weights along that path.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold =
# 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
# The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
# City 0 -> [City 1, City 2]
# City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3]
# City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3]
# City 3 -> [City 1, City 2]
# Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we
# have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]],
# distanceThreshold = 2
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
# The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
# City 0 -> [City 1]
# City 1 -> [City 0, City 4]
# City 2 -> [City 3, City 4]
# City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
# City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3]
# The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 100
#
# 1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
#
# edges[i].length == 3
#
# 0 <= from_i < to_i < n
#
# 1 <= weight_i, distanceThreshold <= 10^4
#
# All pairs (from_i, to_i) are distinct.
