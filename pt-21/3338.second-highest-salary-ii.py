# Table: employees
#
# +------------------+---------+
# | Column Name      | Type    |
# +------------------+---------+
# | emp_id           | int     |
# | salary           | int     |
# | dept             | varchar |
# +------------------+---------+
# emp_id is the unique key for this table.
# Each row of this table contains information about an employee including
# their ID, salary, and department.
#
# Write a solution to find the employees who earn the second-highest
# salary in each department. If multiple employees have the second-highest
# salary, include all employees with that salary.
#
# Return the result table ordered by emp_id in ascending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#
# employees table:
#
# +--------+--------+-----------+
# | emp_id | salary | dept      |
# +--------+--------+-----------+
# | 1      | 70000  | Sales     |
# | 2      | 80000  | Sales     |
# | 3      | 80000  | Sales     |
# | 4      | 90000  | Sales     |
# | 5      | 55000  | IT        |
# | 6      | 65000  | IT        |
# | 7      | 65000  | IT        |
# | 8      | 50000  | Marketing |
# | 9      | 55000  | Marketing |
# | 10     | 55000  | HR        |
# +--------+--------+-----------+
#
# Output:
#
# +--------+-----------+
# | emp_id | dept      |
# +--------+-----------+
# | 2      | Sales     |
# | 3      | Sales     |
# | 5      | IT        |
# | 8      | Marketing |
# +--------+-----------+

# Explanation:
#
# Sales Department:
#
# Highest salary is 90000 (emp_id: 4)
#
# Second-highest salary is 80000 (emp_id: 2, 3)
#
# Both employees with salary 80000 are included
#
# IT Department:
#
# Highest salary is 65000 (emp_id: 6, 7)
#
# Second-highest salary is 55000 (emp_id: 5)
#
# Only emp_id 5 is included as they have the second-highest salary
#
# Marketing Department:
#
# Highest salary is 55000 (emp_id: 9)
#
# Second-highest salary is 50000 (emp_id: 8)
#
# Employee 8 is included
#
# HR Department:
#
# Only has one employee
#
# Not included in the result as it has fewer than 2 employees
