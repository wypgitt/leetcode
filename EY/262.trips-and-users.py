# id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id
# and driver_id are foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table.
# Status is an ENUM (category) type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver',
# 'cancelled_by_client').
#
# Table: Users
#
# +-------------+----------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+----------+
# | users_id | int |
# | banned | enum |
# | role | enum |
# +-------------+----------+
# users_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# The table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an
# ENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').
# banned is an ENUM (category) type of ('Yes', 'No').
#
# The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by
# client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of
# requests with unbanned users on that day.
#
# Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned
# users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between
# "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03" with at least one trip. Round Cancellation Rate
# to two decimal points.
#
# Return the result table in any order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.

# Example 1:

# Trips table:

# Explanation:
# On 2013-10-01:
# - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
# - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so
# it is ignored in the calculation.
# - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
# - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
# On 2013-10-02:
# - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
# - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
# - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
# - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
# On 2013-10-03:
# - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
# - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
# - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
# - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

        Interview explanation:
        Daily cancellation rate only for trips where both client and driver are
        unbanned. Inner-join Users twice with banned = 'No', then aggregate
        cancelled / total per day in the date window.

        Algorithm:
        - JOIN Users as client and driver, both banned = 'No'.
        - Filter request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'.
        - GROUP BY day; rate = SUM(status != completed) / COUNT(*), ROUND 2.

        Complexity: O(T + U) with indexes on user/trip keys; group by day
        over the filtered trip set.
