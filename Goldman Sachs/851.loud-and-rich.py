# Testcase Example:  '[[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]]\n[3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]'
#
# There is a group of n people labeled from 0 to n - 1 where each person has a
# different amount of money and a different level of quietness.
# 
# You are given an array richer where richer[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that ai
# has more money than bi and an integer array quiet where quiet[i] is the
# quietness of the i^th person. All the given data in richer are logically
# correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is richer
# than y and y is richer than x at the same time).
# 
# Return an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet
# person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all
# people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet =
# [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
# Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
# Explanation: 
# answer[0] = 5.
# Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more
# money than 0.
# The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is
# not clear if they have more money than person 0.
# answer[7] = 7.
# Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
# (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest
# (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7.
# The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: richer = [], quiet = [0]
# Output: [0]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == quiet.length
# 1 <= n <= 500
# 0 <= quiet[i] < n
# All the values of quiet are unique.
# 0 <= richer.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
# 0 <= ai, bi < n
# ai != bi
# All the pairs of richer are unique.
# The observations in richer are all logically consistent.
#

"""
Interview explanation:
For each person x, the answer is the quietest person among x and all ancestors in the richer-than DAG. Build edges from poorer person to richer people, then memoized DFS computes the best ancestor answer once per node.

Data structure: adjacency list represents the DAG; ans doubles as memoization.

Edge cases: people with no richer known person answer themselves. The input is acyclic by problem statement, so DFS does not need cycle handling.

Complexity: each node and richer relation is processed once, so O(n + e) time and O(n + e) space.
