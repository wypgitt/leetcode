#
# There is an m x n grid, where (0, 0) is the top-left cell and (m - 1, n - 1)
# is the bottom-right cell. You are given an integer array startPos where
# startPos = [start_row, start_col] indicates that initially, a robot is at the
# cell (start_row, start_col). You are also given an integer array homePos where
# homePos = [home_row, home_col] indicates that its home is at the cell
# (home_row, home_col).
#
# The robot needs to go to its home. It can move one cell in four directions:
# left, right, up, or down, and it can not move outside the boundary. Every move
# incurs some cost. You are further given two 0-indexed integer arrays: rowCosts
# of length m and colCosts of length n.
#
#
# If the robot moves up or down into a cell whose row is r, then this move costs
# rowCosts[r].
#
#
# If the robot moves left or right into a cell whose column is c, then this move
# costs colCosts[c].
#
# Return the minimum total cost for this robot to return home.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: startPos = [1, 0], homePos = [2, 3], rowCosts = [5, 4, 3], colCosts =
# [8, 2, 6, 7]
# Output: 18
# Explanation: One optimal path is that:
# Starting from (1, 0)
# -> It goes down to (2, 0). This move costs rowCosts[2] = 3.
# -> It goes right to (2, 1). This move costs colCosts[1] = 2.
# -> It goes right to (2, 2). This move costs colCosts[2] = 6.
# -> It goes right to (2, 3). This move costs colCosts[3] = 7.
# The total cost is 3 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 18
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: startPos = [0, 0], homePos = [0, 0], rowCosts = [5], colCosts = [26]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The robot is already at its home. Since no moves occur, the total
# cost is 0.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == rowCosts.length
#
#
# n == colCosts.length
#
#
# 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
#
#
# 0 <= rowCosts[r], colCosts[c] <= 10^4
#
#
# startPos.length == 2
#
#
# homePos.length == 2
#
#
# 0 <= start_row, home_row < m
#
#
# 0 <= start_col, home_col < n

        Interview explanation:
        Robot moves 4-directionally; entering cell (r,c) costs rowCosts[r] or
        colCosts[c] depending on the move axis. Start cell is free. Optimal path
        only moves toward home (no detours help).

        Algorithm:
        - Sum rowCosts along the vertical path to home row + colCosts along
          horizontal path to home col (excluding start).

        Complexity: O(|dr|+|dc|) time, O(1) space.
