#
# You are given a 2D integer array towers, where towers[i] = [x_i, y_i,
# q_i] represents the coordinates (x_i, y_i) and quality factor q_i of the
# i^th tower.
#
# You are also given an integer array center = [cx, cy​​​​​​​]
# representing your location, and an integer radius.
#
# A tower is reachable if its Manhattan distance from center is less than
# or equal to radius.
#
# Among all reachable towers:
#
# Return the coordinates of the tower with the maximum quality factor.
#
# If there is a tie, return the tower with the lexicographically smallest
# coordinate. If no tower is reachable, return [-1, -1].
#
# The Manhattan Distance between two cells (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) is
# |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|.
#
# A coordinate [x_i, y_i] is lexicographically smaller than [x_j, y_j] if
# x_i < x_j, or x_i == x_j and y_i < y_j.
#
# |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: towers = [[1,2,5], [2,1,7], [3,1,9]], center = [1,1], radius = 2
#
# Output: [3,1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# Tower [1, 2, 5]: Manhattan distance = |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1, reachable.
#
# Tower [2, 1, 7]: Manhattan distance = |2 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1, reachable.
#
# Tower [3, 1, 9]: Manhattan distance = |3 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 2, reachable.
#
# All towers are reachable. The maximum quality factor is 9, which
# corresponds to tower [3, 1].
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: towers = [[1,3,4], [2,2,4], [4,4,7]], center = [0,0], radius = 5
#
# Output: [1,3]
#
# Explanation:
#
# Tower [1, 3, 4]: Manhattan distance = |1 - 0| + |3 - 0| = 4, reachable.
#
# Tower [2, 2, 4]: Manhattan distance = |2 - 0| + |2 - 0| = 4, reachable.
#
# Tower [4, 4, 7]: Manhattan distance = |4 - 0| + |4 - 0| = 8, not
# reachable.
#
# Among the reachable towers, the maximum quality factor is 4. Both [1, 3]
# and [2, 2] have the same quality, so the lexicographically smaller
# coordinate is [1, 3].
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: towers = [[5,6,8], [0,3,5]], center = [1,2], radius = 1
#
# Output: [-1,-1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# Tower [5, 6, 8]: Manhattan distance = |5 - 1| + |6 - 2| = 8, not
# reachable.
#
# Tower [0, 3, 5]: Manhattan distance = |0 - 1| + |3 - 2| = 2, not
# reachable.
#
# No tower is reachable within the given radius, so [-1, -1] is returned.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= towers.length <= 10^5
#
# towers[i] = [x_i, y_i, q_i]
#
# center = [cx, cy]
#
# 0 <= x_i, y_i, q_i, cx, cy <= 10^5​​​​​​​
#
# 0 <= radius <= 10^5
