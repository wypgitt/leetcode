# Table: Samples
#
# +----------------+---------+
# | Column Name    | Type    |
# +----------------+---------+
# | sample_id      | int     |
# | dna_sequence   | varchar |
# | species        | varchar |
# +----------------+---------+
# sample_id is the unique key for this table.
# Each row contains a DNA sequence represented as a string of characters
# (A, T, G, C) and the species it was collected from.
#
# Biologists are studying basic patterns in DNA sequences. Write a
# solution to identify sample_id with the following patterns:
#
# Sequences that start with ATG (a common start codon)
#
# Sequences that end with either TAA, TAG, or TGA (stop codons)
#
# Sequences containing the motif ATAT (a simple repeated pattern)
#
# Sequences that have at least 3 consecutive G (like GGG or GGGG)
#
# Return the result table ordered by sample_id in ascending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example:

# Input:

# Samples table:

# Note:
#
# The result is ordered by sample_id in ascending order

        Interview explanation:
        Flag each DNA sample for start codon, stop codon, ATAT motif, and
        triple-G runs using LIKE pattern checks.

        Algorithm:
        - has_start: LIKE 'ATG%'
        - has_stop: ends with TAA/TAG/TGA
        - has_atat: LIKE '%ATAT%'
        - has_ggg: LIKE '%GGG%'
