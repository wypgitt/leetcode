# Testcase Example:  "[1,0,1]\n[[0,2]]"
#
#
# You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries,
# where queries[i] = [l_i, r_i].
#
# For each queries[i]:
#
# Select a subset of indices within the range [l_i, r_i] in nums.
#
# Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.
#
# A Zero Array is an array where all elements are equal to 0.
#
# Return true if it is possible to transform nums into a Zero Array after
# processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]
#
# Output: true
#
# Explanation:
#
# For i = 0:
#
# Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these
# indices by 1.
#
# The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2]]
#
# Output: false
#
# Explanation:
#
# For i = 0:
#
# Select the subset of indices as [1, 2, 3] and decrement the values at
# these indices by 1.
#
# The array will become [4, 2, 1, 0].
#
# For i = 1:
#
# Select the subset of indices as [0, 1, 2] and decrement the values at
# these indices by 1.
#
# The array will become [3, 1, 0, 0], which is not a Zero Array.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
#
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
#
# queries[i].length == 2
#
# 0 <= l_i <= r_i < nums.length

        """
        Interview explanation:
        Each query can decrement any subset of [l,r] by 1. So index i can be
        decremented at most (#queries covering i) times → need coverage ≥ nums[i].

        Algorithm:
        - Difference array for query coverage; scan and compare to nums.

        Complexity: O(n + q) time, O(n) space.
