#
# There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You
# are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1,
# where edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] indicates that there is an edge between
# nodes a_i and b_i in the tree.
#
# You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where
# values[i] is the value associated with the i^th node, and an integer k.
#
# A valid split of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges,
# possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all
# have values that are divisible by k, where the value of a connected
# component is the sum of the values of its nodes.
#
# Return the maximum number of components in any valid split.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k
# = 6
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 1 with 2. The resulting
# split is valid because:
# - The value of the component containing nodes 1 and 3 is values[1] +
# values[3] = 12.
# - The value of the component containing nodes 0, 2, and 4 is values[0] +
# values[2] + values[4] = 6.
# It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 2 connected
# components.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values =
# [3,0,6,1,5,2,1], k = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 0 with 2, and the edge
# connecting node 0 with 1. The resulting split is valid because:
# - The value of the component containing node 0 is values[0] = 3.
# - The value of the component containing nodes 2, 5, and 6 is values[2] +
# values[5] + values[6] = 9.
# - The value of the component containing nodes 1, 3, and 4 is values[1] +
# values[3] + values[4] = 6.
# It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 3 connected
# components.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^4
#
# edges.length == n - 1
#
# edges[i].length == 2
#
# 0 <= a_i, b_i < n
#
# values.length == n
#
# 0 <= values[i] <= 10^9
#
# 1 <= k <= 10^9
#
# Sum of values is divisible by k.
#
# The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

        Interview explanation:
        Split a tree by removing edges so every component's value-sum is
        divisible by k; maximize the number of components.

        Algorithm:
        - Rooted DFS returning subtree sum mod k (or the sum). Whenever a
          subtree sum is divisible by k, cut above it and count a component.
        - Total sum is divisible by k, so the remaining root component is valid.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.
