#
# Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call
# the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version
# of the array.
#
# A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and
# each value is an array containing all items in the original array which
# generate that key.
#
# The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string
# key.
#
# The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the
# array. Any order of keys is acceptable.
#
# Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# array = [
#   {"id":"1"},
#   {"id":"1"},
#   {"id":"2"}
# ],
# fn = function (item) {
#   return item.id;
# }
# Output:
# {
#   "1": [{"id": "1"}, {"id": "1"}],
#   "2": [{"id": "2"}]
# }
# Explanation:
# Output is from array.groupBy(fn).
# The selector function gets the "id" out of each item in the array.
# There are two objects with an "id" of 1. Both of those objects are put in the
# first array.
# There is one object with an "id" of 2. That object is put in the second array.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# array = [
#   [1, 2, 3],
#   [1, 3, 5],
#   [1, 5, 9]
# ]
# fn = function (list) {
#   return String(list[0]);
# }
# Output:
# {
#   "1": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]
# }
# Explanation:
# The array can be of any type. In this case, the selector function defines the
# key as being the first element in the array.
# All the arrays have 1 as their first element so they are grouped together.
# {
#   "1": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]
# }
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input:
# array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# fn = function (n) {
#   return String(n > 5);
# }
# Output:
# {
#   "true": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
#   "false": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# }
# Explanation:
# The selector function splits the array by whether each number is greater than
# 5.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 0 <= array.length <= 10^5
#
#
# fn returns a string
#
