#
# You are given a 0-indexed 2D array grid of size 2 x n, where grid[r][c]
# represents the number of points at position (r, c) on the matrix. Two robots
# are playing a game on this matrix.
#
# Both robots initially start at (0, 0) and want to reach (1, n-1). Each robot
# may only move to the right ((r, c) to (r, c + 1)) or down ((r, c) to (r + 1,
# c)).
#
# At the start of the game, the first robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1),
# collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells (r, c)
# traversed on the path, grid[r][c] is set to 0. Then, the second robot moves
# from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting the points on its path. Note that their
# paths may intersect with one another.
#
# The first robot wants to minimize the number of points collected by the second
# robot. In contrast, the second robot wants to maximize the number of points it
# collects. If both robots play optimally, return the number of points collected
# by the second robot.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: grid = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and
# the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
# The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0.
# The second robot will collect 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 4 points.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: grid = [[3,3,1],[8,5,2]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and
# the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
# The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0.
# The second robot will collect 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 4 points.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: grid = [[1,3,1,15],[1,3,3,1]]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: The optimal path taken by the first robot is shown in red, and
# the optimal path taken by the second robot is shown in blue.
# The cells visited by the first robot are set to 0.
# The second robot will collect 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 7 points.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# grid.length == 2
#
#
# n == grid[r].length
#
#
# 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
#
#
# 1 <= grid[r][c] <= 10^5

        Interview explanation:
        2xn grid; first robot zeros a path (0,0)->(1,n-1); second maximizes
        remaining score. Choose first path minimizing second's best.

        Algorithm:
        - First turns down at column i; second gets max(top suffix after i,
          bottom prefix before i). Minimize that max over i.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.
