# Testcase Example:  "[3,8]"
#
# You are given two arrays rowSum and colSum of non-negative integers where
# rowSum[i] is the sum of the elements in the i^th row and colSum[j] is the sum
# of the elements of the j^th column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not
# know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and
# column.
#
# Find any matrix of non-negative integers of size rowSum.length x
# colSum.length that satisfies the rowSum and colSum requirements.
#
# Return a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements.
# It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements
# exists.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: rowSum = [3,8], colSum = [4,7]
# Output: [[3,0],
# [1,7]]
# Explanation:
# 0^th row: 3 + 0 = 3 == rowSum[0]
# 1^st row: 1 + 7 = 8 == rowSum[1]
# 0^th column: 3 + 1 = 4 == colSum[0]
# 1^st column: 0 + 7 = 7 == colSum[1]
# The row and column sums match, and all matrix elements are non-negative.
# Another possible matrix is: [[1,2],
# [3,5]]
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: rowSum = [5,7,10], colSum = [8,6,8]
# Output: [[0,5,0],
# [6,1,0],
# [2,0,8]]
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= rowSum.length, colSum.length <= 500
#
# 0 <= rowSum[i], colSum[i] <= 10^8
#
# sum(rowSum) == sum(colSum)
#
