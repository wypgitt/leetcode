# Testcase Example:  "[[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]"
#
# There are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane.
#
# You are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [left_i,
# sideLength_i] represents the i^th square with a side length of sideLength_i
# that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate left_i.
#
# Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares.
# It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the
# top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right
# side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it
# freezes in place and cannot be moved.
#
# After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current
# tallest stack of squares.
#
# Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described
# above after dropping the i^th square.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: positions = [[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]
# Output: [2,5,5]
# Explanation:
# After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.
# After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of
# 5.
# After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a
# height of 5.
# Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: positions = [[100,100],[200,100]]
# Output: [100,100]
# Explanation:
# After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100.
# After the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both
# with heights of 100.
# Thus, we return an answer of [100, 100].
# Note that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not
# count as landing on it.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= positions.length <= 1000
#
# 1 <= left_i <= 10^8
#
# 1 <= sideLength_i <= 10^6

        """
        Interview explanation:
        Squares fall from [left, left+side) and stack on intersecting intervals.
        After each drop, report current max height. Interval list / coordinate
        compression + segment tree both work; simple interval scan is classic.

        Algorithm:
        - Maintain list of (L, R, height) intervals. For each square, max height
          among overlapping intervals + side becomes new top; append interval;
          track global max.

        Complexity: O(n^2) time, O(n) space (n drops).
