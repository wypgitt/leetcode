#
#
# You are given an integer array nums of length n.
#
# An integer k is called sortable if k divides n and you can sort nums in
# non-decreasing order by sequentially performing the following
# operations:
#
# Partition nums into consecutive subarrays of length k.
#
# Cyclically rotate each subarray independently any number of times to the
# left or to the right.
#
# Return an integer denoting the sum of all possible sortable integers k.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [3,1,2]
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:​​​​​​​
#
# For n = 3, possible divisors are 1 and 3.
#
# For k = 1: each subarray has one element. No rotation can sort the
# array.
#
# For k = 3: the single subarray [3, 1, 2] can be rotated once to produce
# [1, 2, 3], which is sorted.
#
# Only k = 3 is sortable. Hence, the answer is 3.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [7,6,5]
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# For n = 3, possible divisors are 1 and 3.
#
# For k = 1: each subarray has one element. No rotation can sort the
# array.
#
# For k = 3: the single subarray [7, 6, 5] cannot be rotated into
# non-decreasing order.
#
# No k is sortable. Hence, the answer is 0.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [5,8]
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:​​​​​​​
#
# For n = 2, possible divisors are 1 and 2.
#
# Since [5, 8] is already sorted, every divisor is sortable. Hence, the
# answer is 1 + 2 = 3.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
#

        Interview explanation:
        k is sortable iff k|n and each block of length k is a rotation of the
        corresponding sorted segment, with block cuts respecting global order.

        Algorithm:
        - prefix max / suffix min: block boundaries must separate smaller/larger.
        - prefix descent counts: each block may have at most one circular descent
          (necessary & sufficient for being a sorted rotation, with the cuts).
        - Sum all divisors k that pass.

        Complexity: O(n · d(n)) time, O(n) space.
