# Testcase Example:  "[1,2,3]\n[2,1,3]"
#
#
# You are given two integer arrays nums and target, each of length n,
# where nums[i] is the current value at index i and target[i] is the
# desired value at index i.
#
# You may perform the following operation any number of times (including
# zero):
#
# Choose an integer value x
#
# Find all maximal contiguous segments where nums[i] == x (a segment is
# maximal if it cannot be extended to the left or right while keeping all
# values equal to x)
#
# For each such segment [l, r], update simultaneously:
#
# nums[l] = target[l], nums[l + 1] = target[l + 1], ..., nums[r] =
# target[r]
#
# Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums equal to
# target.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = [2,1,3]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:​​​​​​​
#
# Choose x = 1: maximal segment [0, 0] updated -> nums becomes [2, 2, 3]
#
# Choose x = 2: maximal segment [0, 1] updated (nums[0] stays 2, nums[1]
# becomes 1) -> nums becomes [2, 1, 3]
#
# Thus, 2 operations are required to convert nums to target.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [4,1,4], target = [5,1,4]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
# Choose x = 4: maximal segments [0, 0] and [2, 2] updated (nums[2] stays
# 4) -> nums becomes [5, 1, 4]
#
# Thus, 1 operation is required to convert nums to target.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [7,3,7], target = [5,5,9]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
# Choose x = 7: maximal segments [0, 0] and [2, 2] updated -> nums becomes
# [5, 3, 9]
#
# Choose x = 3: maximal segment [1, 1] updated -> nums becomes [5, 5, 9]
#
# Thus, 2 operations are required to convert nums to target.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n == nums.length == target.length <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 10^5

    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Interview explanation:
        Choosing x rewrites every maximal run of x to the corresponding
        target values. Each distinct x that still differs from target needs
        exactly one operation (order can be arranged safely).

        Algorithm:
        - Count distinct nums[i] where nums[i] != target[i].

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.
        """
        return len({x for x, y in zip(nums, target) if x != y})
