#
# You are given a list of preferences for n friends, where n is always even.
#
# For each person i, preferences[i] contains a list of friends sorted in the
# order of preference. In other words, a friend earlier in the list is more
# preferred than a friend later in the list. Friends in each list are denoted
# by integers from 0 to n-1.
#
# All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list
# pairs, where pairs[i] = [x_i, y_i] denotes x_i is paired with y_i and y_i is
# paired with x_i.
#
# However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend x
# is unhappy if x is paired with y and there exists a friend u who is paired
# with v but:
#
# x prefers u over y, and
#
# u prefers x over v.
#
# Return the number of unhappy friends.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 4, preferences = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0], [3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0]],
# pairs = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# Friend 1 is unhappy because:
# - 1 is paired with 0 but prefers 3 over 0, and
# - 3 prefers 1 over 2.
# Friend 3 is unhappy because:
# - 3 is paired with 2 but prefers 1 over 2, and
# - 1 prefers 3 over 0.
# Friends 0 and 2 are happy.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 2, preferences = [[1], [0]], pairs = [[1, 0]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Both friends 0 and 1 are happy.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: n = 4, preferences = [[1, 3, 2], [2, 3, 0], [1, 3, 0], [0, 2, 1]],
# pairs = [[1, 3], [0, 2]]
# Output: 4
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 500
#
# n is even.
#
# preferences.length == n
#
# preferences[i].length == n - 1
#
# 0 <= preferences[i][j] <= n - 1
#
# preferences[i] does not contain i.
#
# All values in preferences[i] are unique.
#
# pairs.length == n/2
#
# pairs[i].length == 2
#
# x_i != y_i
#
# 0 <= x_i, y_i <= n - 1
#
# Each person is contained in exactly one pair.

        Interview explanation:
        Pairing of 2n friends. x is unhappy if exists u preferred over partner
        x's partner, such that u also prefers x over u's partner. Count unhappy
        people. Build rank[x][y]=preference order; for each pair check both.

        Algorithm:
        - rank[x][y] = index in preferences[x]
        - partner[x]= paired person
        - For each x, for each u preferred over partner: if rank[u][x] <
          rank[u][partner[u]]: x unhappy; break.

        Complexity: O(n^2) time/space.
