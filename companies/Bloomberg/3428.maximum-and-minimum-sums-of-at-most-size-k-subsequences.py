#
#
# You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k. Return the
# sum of the maximum and minimum elements of all subsequences of nums with
# at most k elements.
#
# Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2
#
# Output: 24
#
# Explanation:
#
# The subsequences of nums with at most 2 elements are:
#
#                         Subsequence
#                         Minimum
#                         Maximum
#                         Sum

#                         [3]
#                         3
#                         3

#                         [1, 2]
#                         1
#                         2
#                         3
#
#                         [1, 3]
#                         1
#                         3
#                         4
#
#                         [2, 3]
#                         2
#                         3
#                         5
#
#                         Final Total
#
#                         24
#
# The output would be 24.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [5,0,6], k = 1
#
# Output: 22
#
# Explanation:
#
# For subsequences with exactly 1 element, the minimum and maximum values
# are the element itself. Therefore, the total is 5 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 6 =
# 22.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
#
# Output: 12
#
# Explanation:
#
# The subsequences [1, 1] and [1] each appear 3 times. For all of them,
# the minimum and maximum are both 1. Thus, the total is 12.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
#
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
#
# 1 <= k <= min(70, nums.length)
#

        """
        Interview explanation:
        Sort nums. Element nums[i] is max in subsequences that pick it plus at most
        k-1 elements from its left; symmetrically it is min when looking from the
        right. Sum (min+max) contributions mod 1e9+7.

        Algorithm:
        - Precompute C(i, j) for j <= k-1 via Pascal DP.
        - For each i, count = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} C(i, j); add nums[i]*count and
          nums[n-1-i]*count.

        Complexity: O(n k) time, O(n k) space.
