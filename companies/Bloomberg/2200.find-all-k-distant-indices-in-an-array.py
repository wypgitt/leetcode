#
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A
# k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one
# index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.
#
# Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
# Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
# - For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <=
# k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
# - For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
# - For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
# - For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
# - For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
# - For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
# - For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.
# Thus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2
# Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
# Explanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i
# - j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index.
# Hence, we return [0,1,2,3,4].
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
#
#
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
#
#
# key is an integer from the array nums.
#
#
# 1 <= k <= nums.length

        Interview explanation:
        Index i is k-distant if exists j with |i-j|<=k and nums[j]==key. Return
        all such i in ascending order.

        Algorithm:
        (scan / two pointers)
        - Collect key positions; for each i check nearest key within k, or mark
          ranges [j-k, j+k] for each key j and merge.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.

        Interview explanation:
        Alternate: gather key indices; two-pointer expand covered ranges without
        nested full scans overlapping heavily — still mark ranges.

        Algorithm:
        - keys list; for each key add range; merge by scanning once with max reach.
