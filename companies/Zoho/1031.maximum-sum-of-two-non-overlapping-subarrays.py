#
# Given an integer array nums and two integers firstLen and secondLen, return
# the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays with lengths
# firstLen and secondLen.
#
# The array with length firstLen could occur before or after the array with
# length secondLen, but they have to be non-overlapping.
#
# A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [0,6,5,2,2,5,1,9,4], firstLen = 1, secondLen = 2
# Output: 20
# Explanation: One choice of subarrays is [9] with length 1, and [6,5] with
# length 2.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [3,8,1,3,2,1,8,9,0], firstLen = 3, secondLen = 2
# Output: 29
# Explanation: One choice of subarrays is [3,8,1] with length 3, and [8,9] with
# length 2.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [2,1,5,6,0,9,5,0,3,8], firstLen = 4, secondLen = 3
# Output: 31
# Explanation: One choice of subarrays is [5,6,0,9] with length 4, and [0,3,8]
# with length 3.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= firstLen, secondLen <= 1000
#
# 2 <= firstLen + secondLen <= 1000
#
# firstLen + secondLen <= nums.length <= 1000
#
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

        Interview explanation:
        Fix order L then M and M then L. Prefix sums; scan maintaining the best
        first-window sum seen so far before the second window starts.

        Algorithm:
        - pref[i]=sum(nums[:i])
        - Helper(L,M): for i ending M-window, bestL = max sum of L-window ending <= i-M
          ans = max(bestL + M-window)
        - Return max of helper(first,second) and helper(second,first)

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.
