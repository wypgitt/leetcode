#
# You are given an integer n. A perfectly straight street is represented
# by a number line ranging from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer
# array lights representing the street lamp(s) on the street. Each
# lights[i] = [position_i, range_i] indicates that there is a street lamp
# at position position_i that lights up the area from [max(0, position_i -
# range_i), min(n - 1, position_i + range_i)] (inclusive).
#
# The brightness of a position p is defined as the number of street lamps
# that light up the position p. You are given a 0-indexed integer array
# requirement of size n where requirement[i] is the minimum brightness of
# the i^th position on the street.
#
# Return the number of positions i on the street between 0 and n - 1 that
# have a brightness of at least requirement[i].
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 5, lights = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,2]], requirement = [0,2,1,4,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# - The first street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 0 - 1), min(n -
# 1, 0 + 1)] = [0, 1] (inclusive).
# - The second street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 2 - 1), min(n -
# 1, 2 + 1)] = [1, 3] (inclusive).
# - The third street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 3 - 2), min(n -
# 1, 3 + 2)] = [1, 4] (inclusive).
#
# - Position 0 is covered by the first street lamp. It is covered by 1
# street lamp which is greater than requirement[0].
# - Position 1 is covered by the first, second, and third street lamps. It
# is covered by 3 street lamps which is greater than requirement[1].
# - Position 2 is covered by the second and third street lamps. It is
# covered by 2 street lamps which is greater than requirement[2].
# - Position 3 is covered by the second and third street lamps. It is
# covered by 2 street lamps which is less than requirement[3].
# - Position 4 is covered by the third street lamp. It is covered by 1
# street lamp which is equal to requirement[4].
#
# Positions 0, 1, 2, and 4 meet the requirement so we return 4.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 1, lights = [[0,1]], requirement = [2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# - The first street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 0 - 1), min(n -
# 1, 0 + 1)] = [0, 0] (inclusive).
# - Position 0 is covered by the first street lamp. It is covered by 1
# street lamp which is less than requirement[0].
# - We return 0 because no position meets their brightness requirement.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= lights.length <= 10^5
#
# 0 <= position_i < n
#
# 0 <= range_i <= 10^5
#
# requirement.length == n
#
# 0 <= requirement[i] <= 10^5

        Interview explanation:
        Premium. Street positions 0..n-1. Light [pos, range] covers
        [pos-range, pos+range] clamped to street. Count positions i where
        brightness >= requirement[i].

        Algorithm:
        (difference array)
        - +1 at L, -1 at R+1; prefix sum brightness; count.

        Complexity: O(n + m) time, O(n) space.
