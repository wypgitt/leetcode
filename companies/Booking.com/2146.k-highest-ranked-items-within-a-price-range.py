#
# You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n that represents
# a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the
# following:
#
#
# 0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
#
#
# 1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
#
#
# All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You
# may also freely move to and from these item cells.
#
# It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.
#
# You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low,
# high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row,
# col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high]
# (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.
#
# You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices
# are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these
# criteria that is different:
#
#
# Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter
# distance has a higher rank).
#
#
# Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
#
#
# The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
#
#
# The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).
#
# Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank
# (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the
# price range, return all of them.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,0,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,5], start = [0,0],
# k = 3
# Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
# Explanation: You start at (0,0).
# With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and
# (2,2).
# The ranks of these items are:
# - (0,1) with distance 1
# - (1,1) with distance 2
# - (2,1) with distance 3
# - (2,2) with distance 4
# Thus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and
# (2,1).
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,3,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,3], start = [2,3],
# k = 2
# Output: [[2,1],[1,2]]
# Explanation: You start at (2,3).
# With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and
# (2,1).
# The ranks of these items are:
# - (2,1) with distance 2, price 2
# - (1,2) with distance 2, price 3
# - (1,1) with distance 3
# - (0,1) with distance 4
# Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3
# Output: [[2,1],[2,0]]
# Explanation: You start at (0,0).
# With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1).
# The ranks of these items are:
# - (2,1) with distance 5
# - (2,0) with distance 6
# Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0).
# Note that k = 3 but there are only 2 reachable items within the price range.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == grid.length
#
#
# n == grid[i].length
#
#
# 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
#
#
# 1 <= m * n <= 10^5
#
#
# 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5
#
#
# pricing.length == 2
#
#
# 2 <= low <= high <= 10^5
#
#
# start.length == 2
#
#
# 0 <= row <= m - 1
#
#
# 0 <= col <= n - 1
#
#
# grid[row][col] > 0

# 1 <= k <= m * n

        Algorithm:
        - BFS from start for shortest distances; collect cells with value > 1 in
          price range; sort by rank key; take first k.
