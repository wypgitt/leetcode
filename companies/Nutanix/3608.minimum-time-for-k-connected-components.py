# Testcase Example:  "2\n[[0,1,3]]\n2"
#
#
# You are given an integer n and an undirected graph with n nodes labeled
# from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges, where edges[i]
# = [u_i, v_i, time_i] indicates an undirected edge between nodes u_i and
# v_i that can be removed at time_i.
#
# You are also given an integer k.
#
# Initially, the graph may be connected or disconnected. Your task is to
# find the minimum time t such that after removing all edges with time <=
# t, the graph contains at least k connected components.
#
# Return the minimum time t.
#
# A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a
# path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an
# edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1,3]], k = 2
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
#
# Initially, there is one connected component {0, 1}.
#
# At time = 1 or 2, the graph remains unchanged.
#
# At time = 3, edge [0, 1] is removed, resulting in k = 2 connected
# components {0}, {1}. Thus, the answer is 3.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4]], k = 3
#
# Output: 4
#
# Explanation:
#
# Initially, there is one connected component {0, 1, 2}.
#
# At time = 2, edge [0, 1] is removed, resulting in two connected
# components {0}, {1, 2}.
#
# At time = 4, edge [1, 2] is removed, resulting in k = 3 connected
# components {0}, {1}, {2}. Thus, the answer is 4.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,2,5]], k = 2
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# Since there are already k = 2 disconnected components {1}, {0, 2}, no
# edge removal is needed. Thus, the answer is 0.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
#
# 0 <= edges.length <= 10^5
#
# edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, time_i]
#
# 0 <= u_i, v_i < n
#
# u_i != v_i
#
# 1 <= time_i <= 10^9
#
# 1 <= k <= n
#
# There are no duplicate edges.

        Algorithm:
        - Sort edges by time ascending; add from largest time downward.
        - Before adding an edge of time t we keep only edges with time > t.
        - When components == k at that moment, t is the answer; else 0.
