# Testcase Example:  "1002"
#
#
# You are given an integer n.
#
# Return the total number of commas used when writing all integers from
# [1, n] (inclusive) in standard number formatting.
#
# In standard formatting:
#
# A comma is inserted after every three digits from the right.
#
# Numbers with fewer than 4 digits contain no commas.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 1002
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
#
# The numbers "1,000", "1,001", and "1,002" each contain one comma, giving
# a total of 3.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 998
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# All numbers from 1 to 998 have fewer than four digits. Therefore, no
# commas are used.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
#

        Interview explanation:
        Under n≤1e5, every integer in [1000,n] uses exactly one thousands comma.

        Algorithm:
        - Count max(0, n - 999).

        Complexity: O(1) time, O(1) space.
