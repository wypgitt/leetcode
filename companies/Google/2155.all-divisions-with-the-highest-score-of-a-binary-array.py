#
# You are given a 0-indexed binary array nums of length n. nums can be divided
# at index i (where 0 <= i <= n) into two arrays (possibly empty) nums_left and
# nums_right:
#
#
# nums_left has all the elements of nums between index 0 and i - 1 (inclusive),
# while nums_right has all the elements of nums between index i and n - 1
# (inclusive).
#
#
# If i == 0, nums_left is empty, while nums_right has all the elements of nums.
#
#
# If i == n, nums_left has all the elements of nums, while nums_right is empty.
#
# The division score of an index i is the sum of the number of 0's in nums_left
# and the number of 1's in nums_right.
#
# Return all distinct indices that have the highest possible division score. You
# may return the answer in any order.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,0]
# Output: [2,4]
# Explanation: Division at index
# - 0: nums_left is []. nums_right is [0,0,1,0]. The score is 0 + 1 = 1.
# - 1: nums_left is [0]. nums_right is [0,1,0]. The score is 1 + 1 = 2.
# - 2: nums_left is [0,0]. nums_right is [1,0]. The score is 2 + 1 = 3.
# - 3: nums_left is [0,0,1]. nums_right is [0]. The score is 2 + 0 = 2.
# - 4: nums_left is [0,0,1,0]. nums_right is []. The score is 3 + 0 = 3.
# Indices 2 and 4 both have the highest possible division score 3.
# Note the answer [4,2] would also be accepted.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [0,0,0]
# Output: [3]
# Explanation: Division at index
# - 0: nums_left is []. nums_right is [0,0,0]. The score is 0 + 0 = 0.
# - 1: nums_left is [0]. nums_right is [0,0]. The score is 1 + 0 = 1.
# - 2: nums_left is [0,0]. nums_right is [0]. The score is 2 + 0 = 2.
# - 3: nums_left is [0,0,0]. nums_right is []. The score is 3 + 0 = 3.
# Only index 3 has the highest possible division score 3.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [1,1]
# Output: [0]
# Explanation: Division at index
# - 0: nums_left is []. nums_right is [1,1]. The score is 0 + 2 = 2.
# - 1: nums_left is [1]. nums_right is [1]. The score is 0 + 1 = 1.
# - 2: nums_left is [1,1]. nums_right is []. The score is 0 + 0 = 0.
# Only index 0 has the highest possible division score 2.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == nums.length
#
#
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
#
#
# nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
#

        Interview explanation:
        Division at index i: left = nums[0..i), right = nums[i..n). Score =
        (# of 0s in left) + (# of 1s in right). Return all i with max score.
