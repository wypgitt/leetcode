# Table: Calls
#
# +--------------+----------+
# | Column Name  | Type     |
# +--------------+----------+
# | caller_id    | int      |
# | recipient_id | int      |
# | call_time    | datetime |
# | city         | varchar  |
# +--------------+----------+
# (caller_id, recipient_id, call_time) is the primary key (combination of
# columns with unique values) for this table.
# Each row contains caller id, recipient id, call time, and city.
#
# Write a solution to find the peak calling hour for each city. If
# multiple hours have the same number of calls, all of those hours will be
# recognized as peak hours for that specific city.
#
# Return the result table ordered by peak calling hour and city in
# descending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Calls table:
# +-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
# | caller_id | recipient_id | call_time           | city     |
# +-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
# | 8         | 4            | 2021-08-24 22:46:07 | Houston  |
# | 4         | 8            | 2021-08-24 22:57:13 | Houston  |
# | 5         | 1            | 2021-08-11 21:28:44 | Houston  |
# | 8         | 3            | 2021-08-17 22:04:15 | Houston  |
# | 11        | 3            | 2021-08-17 13:07:00 | New York |
# | 8         | 11           | 2021-08-17 14:22:22 | New York |
# +-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
# Output:
# +----------+-------------------+-----------------+
# | city     | peak_calling_hour | number_of_calls |
# +----------+-------------------+-----------------+
# | Houston  | 22                | 3               |
# | New York | 14                | 1               |
# | New York | 13                | 1               |
# +----------+-------------------+-----------------+
# Explanation:
# For Houston:
#   - The peak time is 22:00, with a total of 3 calls recorded.
# For New York:
#   - Both 13:00 and 14:00 hours have equal call counts of 1, so both
# times are considered peak hours.
# Output table is ordered by peak_calling_hour and city in descending
# order.

        - GROUP BY city, HOUR(call_time); RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city
          ORDER BY count DESC); keep rank = 1.
