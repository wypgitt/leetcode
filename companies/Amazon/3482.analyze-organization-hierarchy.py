# Table: Employees
#
# +----------------+---------+
# | Column Name    | Type    |
# +----------------+---------+
# | employee_id    | int     |
# | employee_name  | varchar |
# | manager_id     | int     |
# | salary         | int     |
# | department     | varchar |
# +----------------+----------+
# employee_id is the unique key for this table.
# Each row contains information about an employee, including their ID,
# name, their manager's ID, salary, and department.
# manager_id is null for the top-level manager (CEO).
#
# Write a solution to analyze the organizational hierarchy and answer the
# following:
#
# Hierarchy Levels: For each employee, determine their level in the
# organization (CEO is level 1, employees reporting directly to the CEO
# are level 2, and so on).
#
# Team Size: For each employee who is a manager, count the total number of
# employees under them (direct and indirect reports).
#
# Salary Budget: For each manager, calculate the total salary budget they
# control (sum of salaries of all employees under them, including indirect
# reports, plus their own salary).
#
# Return the result table ordered by the result ordered by level in
# ascending order, then by budget in descending order, and finally by
# employee_name in ascending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#
# Employees table:
#
# +-------------+---------------+------------+--------+-------------+
# | employee_id | employee_name | manager_id | salary | department  |
# +-------------+---------------+------------+--------+-------------+

# | 3           | Charlie       | 1          | 10000  | Engineering |
# | 4           | David         | 2          | 7500   | Sales       |

# Explanation:
#
# Organization Structure:
#
# Alice (ID: 1) is the CEO (level 1) with no manager
#
# Bob (ID: 2) and Charlie (ID: 3) report directly to Alice (level 2)
#
# David (ID: 4), Eva (ID: 5) report to Bob, while Frank (ID: 6) and Grace
# (ID: 7) report to Charlie (level 3)
#
# Hank (ID: 8) reports to David, and Ivy (ID: 9) and Judy (ID: 10) report
# to Frank (level 4)
#
# Level Calculation:
#
# The CEO (Alice) is at level 1
#
# Each subsequent level of management adds 1 to the level
#
# Team Size Calculation:
#
# Alice has 9 employees under her (the entire company except herself)
#
# Bob has 3 employees (David, Eva, and Hank)
#
# Charlie has 4 employees (Frank, Grace, Ivy, and Judy)
#
# David has 1 employee (Hank)
#
# Frank has 2 employees (Ivy and Judy)
#
# Eva, Grace, Hank, Ivy, and Judy have no direct reports (team_size = 0)
#
# Budget Calculation:
#
# Alice's budget: Her salary (12000) + all employees' salaries (72500) =
# 84500
#
# Charlie's budget: His salary (10000) + Frank's budget (23000) + Grace's
# salary (8500) = 41500
#
# Bob's budget: His salary (10000) + David's budget (13500) + Eva's salary
# (7500) = 31000
#
# Frank's budget: His salary (9000) + Ivy's salary (7000) + Judy's salary
# (7000) = 23000
#
# David's budget: His salary (7500) + Hank's salary (6000) = 13500
#
# Employees with no direct reports have budgets equal to their own salary
#
# Note:
#
# The result is ordered first by level in ascending order
#
# Within the same level, employees are ordered by budget in descending
# order then by name in ascending order
