#
# A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.
#
# Given an array of strings arr, and an integer k, return the k^th distinct
# string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an
# empty string "".
#
# Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the
# array.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
# Output: "a"
# Explanation:
# The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".
# "d" appears 1^st, so it is the 1^st distinct string.
# "a" appears 2^nd, so it is the 2^nd distinct string.
# Since k == 2, "a" is returned.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1
# Output: "aaa"
# Explanation:
# All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1^st string "aaa" is returned.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: arr = ["a","b","a"], k = 3
# Output: ""
# Explanation:
# The only distinct string is "b". Since there are fewer than 3 distinct
# strings, we return an empty string "".
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= k <= arr.length <= 1000
#
#
# 1 <= arr[i].length <= 5
#
#
# arr[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

    def kthDistinct(self, arr: List[str], k: int) -> str:

        Interview explanation:
        Distinct strings appear exactly once. Return the k-th such string in
        order of appearance, or "" if fewer than k exist.

        Algorithm:
        - Frequency count; scan left-to-right, count down k on freq==1.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.
