# record_id is the unique identifier for this table.
# Each row represents a borrowing transaction and return_date is NULL if
# the book is currently borrowed and hasn't been returned yet.
#
# Write a solution to find all books that are currently borrowed (not
# returned) and have zero copies available in the library.
#
# A book is considered currently borrowed if there exists a borrowing
# record with a NULL return_date
#
# Return the result table ordered by current borrowers in descending
# order, then by book title in ascending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.

# Explanation:
#
# The Great Gatsby (book_id = 1):
#
# Total copies: 3
#
# Currently borrowed by Alice Smith, Bob Johnson, and Grace Miller (3
# borrowers)
#
# Available copies: 3 - 3 = 0
#
# Included because available_copies = 0
#
# 1984 (book_id = 3):
#
# Total copies: 1
#
# Currently borrowed by David Brown (1 borrower)
#
# Available copies: 1 - 1 = 0
#
# Included because available_copies = 0
#
# Books not included:
#
# To Kill a Mockingbird (book_id = 2): Total copies = 3, current borrowers
# = 2, available = 1
#
# Pride and Prejudice (book_id = 4): Total copies = 2, current borrowers =
# 1, available = 1
#
# The Catcher in the Rye (book_id = 5): Total copies = 1, current
# borrowers = 0, available = 1
#
# Brave New World (book_id = 6): Total copies = 4, current borrowers = 1,
# available = 3
#
# Result ordering:
#
# The Great Gatsby appears first with 3 current borrowers
#
# 1984 appears second with 1 current borrower
#
# Output table is ordered by current_borrowers in descending order, then
# by book_title in ascending order.
