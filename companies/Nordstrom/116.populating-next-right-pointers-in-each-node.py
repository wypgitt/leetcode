# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]'
#
# You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level,
# and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following
# definition:
# 
# 
# struct Node {
# ⁠ int val;
# ⁠ Node *left;
# ⁠ Node *right;
# ⁠ Node *next;
# }
# 
# 
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
# next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
# 
# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
# Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function
# should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like
# in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next
# pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2^12 - 1].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 
# 
# 
# Follow-up:
# 
# 
# You may only use constant extra space.
# The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not
# count as extra space for this problem.

        Interview explanation:
        The tree is perfect, so every internal node has both children and all
        leaves are aligned. That structure lets us connect in O(1) extra space:
        for each level, connect left child to right child, and right child to the
        next node's left child using the already established next pointers.

        Edge cases and tests:
        - Empty root returns None.
        - One node returns itself with next still None.
        - Cross-parent links such as node.left.right -> node.next.left are the
          core perfect-tree case.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) extra space.
