# Testcase Example:  "[1,5,4,2,9,9,9]\n3"
#
# You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the maximum
# subarray sum of all the subarrays of nums that meet the following conditions:
#
#
# The length of the subarray is k, and
#
#
# All the elements of the subarray are distinct.
#
# Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions.
# If no subarray meets the conditions, return 0.
#
# A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
# Output: 15
# Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
# - [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
# - [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
# - [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
# - [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is
# repeated.
# - [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is
# repeated.
# We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that
# meet the conditions
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
# - [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is
# repeated.
# We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
#
#
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
#

        Interview explanation:
        Max sum among subarrays of length k with all distinct elements.

        Algorithm:
        - Sliding window of size k with frequency map; track sum when size==k.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(k) space.
