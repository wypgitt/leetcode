#
# There is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices labeled from 0 to
# n - 1.
#
# You are given the integer n and an array edges, where edges[i] = [u_i,
# v_i, w_i] indicates that there is an edge between vertices u_i and v_i
# with a weight of w_i.
#
# A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts
# and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes
# before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note
# that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.
#
# The cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as
# the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk.
# In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the
# walk is w_0, w_1, w_2, ..., w_k, then the cost is calculated as w_0 &
# w_1 & w_2 & ... & w_k, where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.
#
# You are also given a 2D array query, where query[i] = [s_i, t_i]. For
# each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at
# vertex s_i and ending at vertex t_i. If there exists no such walk, the
# answer is -1.
#
# Return the array answer, where answer[i] denotes the minimum cost of a
# walk for query i.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]
#
# Output: [1,-1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# To achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the
# following edges: 0->1 (weight 7), 1->2 (weight 1), 2->1 (weight 1), 1->3
# (weight 7).
#
# In the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the
# answer is -1.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query =
# [[1,2]]
#
# Output: [0]
#
# Explanation:
#
# To achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the
# following edges: 1->2 (weight 1), 2->1 (weight 6), 1->2 (weight 1).
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 10^5
#
# 0 <= edges.length <= 10^5
#
# edges[i].length == 3
#
# 0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1
#
# u_i != v_i
#
# 0 <= w_i <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= query.length <= 10^5
#
# query[i].length == 2
#
# 0 <= s_i, t_i <= n - 1
#
# s_i != t_i

        """
        Interview explanation:
        Walk cost = AND of edge weights used (edges reusable). Minimize cost
        s→t; disconnected → -1. AND only shrinks, so take AND of all edges in
        the connected component.

        Algorithm:
        - Union-Find components while AND-ing every edge weight into the root.
        - Query: same component → component AND, else -1.

        Complexity: O((n + E + Q) α(n)) time, O(n) space.
