#
# You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a graph,
# labeled from 0 to n - 1.
#
# You are also given an integer array nums of length n and an integer
# maxDiff.
#
# An undirected edge exists between nodes i and j if the absolute
# difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most maxDiff (i.e.,
# |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff).
#
# You are also given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] =
# [u_i, v_i], find the minimum distance between nodes u_i and v_i_. If no
# path exists between the two nodes, return -1 for that query.
#
# Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the result of the i^th query.
#
# Note: The edges between the nodes are unweighted.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 5, nums = [1,8,3,4,2], maxDiff = 3, queries = [[0,3],[2,4]]
#
# Output: [1,1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The resulting graph is:
#
#                         Query
#                         Shortest Path
#                         Minimum Distance
#
#                         [0, 3]
#                         0 → 3
#                         1
#
#                         [2, 4]
#                         2 → 4
#                         1
#
# Thus, the output is [1, 1].
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 5, nums = [5,3,1,9,10], maxDiff = 2, queries =
# [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[4,3]]
#
# Output: [1,2,-1,1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The resulting graph is:
#
#                         Query
#                         Shortest Path
#                         Minimum Distance
#
#                         [0, 1]
#                         0 → 1
#                         1
#
#                         [0, 2]
#                         0 → 1 → 2
#                         2
#
#                         [2, 3]
#                         None
#                         -1
#
#                         [4, 3]
#                         3 → 4
#                         1
#
# Thus, the output is [1, 2, -1, 1].
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: n = 3, nums = [3,6,1], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2]]
#
# Output: [0,-1,-1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# There are no edges between any two nodes because:
#
# Nodes 0 and 1: |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |3 - 6| = 3 > 1
#
# Nodes 0 and 2: |nums[0] - nums[2]| = |3 - 1| = 2 > 1
#
# Nodes 1 and 2: |nums[1] - nums[2]| = |6 - 1| = 5 > 1
#
# Thus, no node can reach any other node, and the output is [0, -1, -1].
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5
#
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
#
# 0 <= maxDiff <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
#
# queries[i] == [u_i, v_i]
#
# 0 <= u_i, v_i < n

        Interview explanation:
        Sort nodes by value. One edge can jump to the farthest node within
        maxDiff on that line; shortest paths are minimum jumps. Binary lifting
        answers each query in O(log n).

        Algorithm:
        - Sort values; two pointers → jump[0][i] = farthest index from i.
        - jump[k][i] = jump[k-1][jump[k-1][i]].
        - Map nodes to ranks; lift from lower rank until reaching higher rank.

        Complexity: O((n + q) log n) time, O(n log n) space.
