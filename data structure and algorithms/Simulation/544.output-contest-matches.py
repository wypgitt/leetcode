#
# During the NBA playoffs, we always set the rather strong team to play
# with the rather weak team, like making the rank 1 team play with the
# rank n^th team, which is a good strategy to make the contest more
# interesting.
#
# Given n teams, return their final contest matches in the form of a
# string.
#
# The n teams are labeled from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank
# (i.e., Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team).
#
# We will use parentheses '(', and ')' and commas ',' to represent the
# contest team pairing. We use the parentheses for pairing and the commas
# for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need
# to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the
# rather weak one.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 4
# Output: "((1,4),(2,3))"
# Explanation:
# In the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the teams 2 and 3
# together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.
# And we got (1, 4),(2, 3).
# In the second round, the winners of (1, 4) and (2, 3) need to play again
# to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside
# them.
# And we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 8
# Output: "(((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))"
# Explanation:
# First round: (1, 8),(2, 7),(3, 6),(4, 5)
# Second round: ((1, 8),(4, 5)),((2, 7),(3, 6))
# Third round: (((1, 8),(4, 5)),((2, 7),(3, 6)))
# Since the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output
# the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).
#
# Constraints:
#
# n == 2^x where x in in the range [1, 12].

        Interview explanation:
        Seed teams 1..n. Each round, pair strongest with weakest: (1,n),
        (2,n-1), ... Form next-round list of parenthesized match strings until
        one string remains.

        Algorithm:
        - Start with [str(i) for i in 1..n].
        - While len > 1: new[i] = '(' + a[i] + ',' + a[len-1-i] + ')'.

        Complexity: O(n) time and space for building the final string size.
