#
#
# You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [price_i,
# weight_i] denotes the price and weight of the i^th item, respectively.
#
# You are also given a positive integer capacity.
#
# Each item can be divided into two items with ratios part1 and part2,
# where part1 + part2 == 1.
#
# The weight of the first item is weight_i * part1 and the price of the
# first item is price_i * part1.
#
# Similarly, the weight of the second item is weight_i * part2 and the
# price of the second item is price_i * part2.
#
# Return the maximum total price to fill a bag of capacity capacity with
# given items. If it is impossible to fill a bag return -1. Answers within
# 10^-5 of the actual answer will be considered accepted.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: items = [[50,1],[10,8]], capacity = 5
# Output: 55.00000
# Explanation:
# We divide the 2^nd item into two parts with part1 = 0.5 and part2 = 0.5.
# The price and weight of the 1^st item are 5, 4. And similarly, the price
# and the weight of the 2^nd item are 5, 4.
# The array items after operation becomes [[50,1],[5,4],[5,4]].
# To fill a bag with capacity 5 we take the 1^st element with a price of
# 50 and the 2^nd element with a price of 5.
# It can be proved that 55.0 is the maximum total price that we can
# achieve.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: items = [[100,30]], capacity = 50
# Output: -1.00000
# Explanation: It is impossible to fill a bag with the given item.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= items.length <= 10^5
#
# items[i].length == 2
#
# 1 <= price_i, weight_i <= 10^4
#
# 1 <= capacity <= 10^9

class Solution:
    def maxPrice(self, items: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> float:
        """
        Interview explanation:
        items[i]=[price, weight]; may take fractional parts (proportional price).
        Exactly fill capacity; maximize total price, or -1 if impossible.

        Algorithm:
        (fractional knapsack greedy)
        - Sort by unit price price/weight descending.
        - Take whole items while they fit; take a fraction of the next to fill
          remaining capacity. If leftover capacity after all items, return -1.

        Complexity: O(n log n) time, O(n) space.
