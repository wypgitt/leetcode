#
# A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street
# has building(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array
# buildings, where buildings[i] = [start_i, end_i, height_i]. This means
# that there is a building with height_i in the half-closed segment
# [start_i, end_i).
#
# You want to describe the heights of the buildings on the street with the
# minimum number of non-overlapping segments. The street can be
# represented by the 2D integer array street where street[j] = [left_j,
# right_j, average_j] describes a half-closed segment [left_j, right_j) of
# the road where the average heights of the buildings in the segment is
# average_j.
#
# For example, if buildings = [[1,5,2],[3,10,4]], the street could be
# represented by street = [[1,3,2],[3,5,3],[5,10,4]] because:
#
# From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of
# 2 / 1 = 2.
#
# From 3 to 5, both the first and the second building are there with an
# average height of (2+4) / 2 = 3.
#
# From 5 to 10, there is only the second building with an average height
# of 4 / 1 = 4.
#
# Given buildings, return the 2D integer array street as described above
# (excluding any areas of the street where there are no buldings). You may
# return the array in any order.
#
# The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided (integer
# division) by n.
#
# A half-closed segment [a, b) is the section of the number line between
# points a and b including point a and not including point b.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: buildings = [[1,4,2],[3,9,4]]
# Output: [[1,3,2],[3,4,3],[4,9,4]]
# Explanation:
# From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of
# 2 / 1 = 2.
# From 3 to 4, both the first and the second building are there with an
# average height of (2+4) / 2 = 3.
# From 4 to 9, there is only the second building with an average height of
# 4 / 1 = 4.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: buildings = [[1,3,2],[2,5,3],[2,8,3]]
# Output: [[1,3,2],[3,8,3]]
# Explanation:
# From 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of
# 2 / 1 = 2.
# From 2 to 3, all three buildings are there with an average height of
# (2+3+3) / 3 = 2.
# From 3 to 5, both the second and the third building are there with an
# average height of (3+3) / 2 = 3.
# From 5 to 8, there is only the last building with an average height of 3
# / 1 = 3.
# The average height from 1 to 3 is the same so we can group them into one
# segment.
# The average height from 3 to 8 is the same so we can group them into one
# segment.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: buildings = [[1,2,1],[5,6,1]]
# Output: [[1,2,1],[5,6,1]]
# Explanation:
# From 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of
# 1 / 1 = 1.
# From 2 to 5, there are no buildings, so it is not included in the
# output.
# From 5 to 6, there is only the second building with an average height of
# 1 / 1 = 1.
# We cannot group the segments together because an empty space with no
# buildings seperates the segments.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= buildings.length <= 10^5
#
# buildings[i].length == 3
#
# 0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^8
#
# 1 <= height_i <= 10^5
