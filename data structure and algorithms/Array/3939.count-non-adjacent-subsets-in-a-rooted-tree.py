#
#
# You are given a rooted tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1,
# represented by an integer array parent of length n, where:
#
# parent[0] = -1 (node 0 is the root).
#
# For each 1 <= i < n, parent[i] is the parent of node i (0 <= parent[i] <
# i).
#
# You are also given an integer array nums of length n, where nums[i] is
# the value of node i, and an integer k.
#
# A non-empty subset of nodes is called valid if:
#
# The sum of the values of the selected nodes is divisible by k.
#
# No two selected nodes are adjacent in the tree (no node and its direct
# parent are both included in the subset).
#
# Return the number of valid subsets modulo 10^9 + 7.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: parent = [-1,0,1], nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
# ​​​​​​​
#
# The only valid subset is {2}. It contains node 2 with value 3, which is
# divisible by 3.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: parent = [-1,0,0,0], nums = [2,1,2,1], k = 3
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
# ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
#
# The valid subsets are:
#
# {1, 2}: Nodes 1 and 2 are both children of node 0 and not directly
# connected to each other. Their values sum to 1 + 2 = 3, which is
# divisible by 3.
#
# {2, 3}: Nodes 2 and 3 are also non-adjacent. Their values sum to 2 + 1 =
# 3, which is divisible by 3.
#
# No other subset satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the answer is 2.
#
# Constraints:
#
# n == parent.length == nums.length
#
# 1 <= n <= 1000
#
# parent[0] == -1
#
# For all 1 <= i < n:
#
# 0 <= parent[i] < i
#
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
#
# 1 <= k <= 100​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
#
# parent describes a valid rooted tree.

        """
        Interview explanation:
        Tree DP over independent sets with subset-sum modulo k. For each node
        keep maps of ways when the node is taken vs skipped; combine children
        with convolution mod k (taken node forbids taking a child).

        Algorithm:
        - Build children lists from parent.
        - DFS: sel starts as {nums[u]%k: 1}, skip as {0: 1}.
        - Merge each child: skip ⊗ (child_sel + child_skip);
          sel ⊗ child_skip only.
        - Answer (sel[0] + skip[0] - 1) mod 1e9+7 (drop empty set).

        Complexity: O(n * k^2 * branching) ~ O(n^2 k^2) worst, fine for n,k<=1000/100.
