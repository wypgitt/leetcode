#
# You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1
# to n. You are also given a 2D array roads, where roads[i] = [a_i, b_i,
# cost_i] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities a_i
# and b_i with a cost of traveling equal to cost_i.
#
# You can buy apples in any city you want, but some cities have different
# costs to buy apples. You are given the 1-based array appleCost where
# appleCost[i] is the cost of buying one apple from city i.
#
# You start at some city, traverse through various roads, and eventually
# buy exactly one apple from any city. After you buy that apple, you have
# to return back to the city you started at, but now the cost of all the
# roads will be multiplied by a given factor k.
#
# Given the integer k, return a 1-based array answer of size n where
# answer[i] is the minimum total cost to buy an apple if you start at city
# i.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,4],[2,3,2],[2,4,5],[3,4,1],[1,3,4]],
# appleCost = [56,42,102,301], k = 2
# Output: [54,42,48,51]
# Explanation: The minimum cost for each starting city is the following:
# - Starting at city 1: You take the path 1 -> 2, buy an apple at city 2,
# and finally take the path 2 -> 1. The total cost is 4 + 42 + 4 * 2 = 54.
# - Starting at city 2: You directly buy an apple at city 2. The total
# cost is 42.
# - Starting at city 3: You take the path 3 -> 2, buy an apple at city 2,
# and finally take the path 2 -> 3. The total cost is 2 + 42 + 2 * 2 = 48.
# - Starting at city 4: You take the path 4 -> 3 -> 2 then you buy at city
# 2, and finally take the path 2 -> 3 -> 4. The total cost is 1 + 2 + 42 +
# 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 51.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 3, roads = [[1,2,5],[2,3,1],[3,1,2]], appleCost = [2,3,1], k
# = 3
# Output: [2,3,1]
# Explanation: It is always optimal to buy the apple in the starting city.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 1000
#
# 1 <= roads.length <= 2000
#
# 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n
#
# a_i != b_i
#
# 1 <= cost_i <= 10^5
#
# appleCost.length == n
#
# 1 <= appleCost[i] <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= k <= 100
#
# There are no repeated edges.

        Interview explanation:
        Premium. From each start city, travel to buy one apple then return;
        return trip multiplies road costs by k. Minimize cost per start.

        Algorithm:
        - Cost = appleCost[u] + dist(start,u) + k*dist(start,u)
               = appleCost[u] + (k+1)*dist. Dijkstra from each start
          (or multi-source style); take min over u.

        Complexity: O(n * (m log m)) time, O(n+m) space.
