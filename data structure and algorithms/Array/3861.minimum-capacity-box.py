#
#
# You are given an integer array capacity, where capacity[i] represents
# the capacity of the i^th box, and an integer itemSize representing the
# size of an item.
#
# The i^th box can store the item if capacity[i] >= itemSize.
#
# Return an integer denoting the index of the box with the minimum
# capacity that can store the item. If multiple such boxes exist, return
# the smallest index.
#
# If no box can store the item, return -1.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: capacity = [1,5,3,7], itemSize = 3
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
# The box at index 2 has a capacity of 3, which is the minimum capacity
# that can store the item. Thus, the answer is 2.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: capacity = [3,5,4,3], itemSize = 2
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# The minimum capacity that can store the item is 3, and it appears at
# indices 0 and 3. Thus, the answer is 0.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: capacity = [4], itemSize = 5
#
# Output: -1
#
# Explanation:
#
# No box has enough capacity to store the item, so the answer is -1.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= capacity.length <= 100
#
# 1 <= capacity[i] <= 100
#
# 1 <= itemSize <= 100
#

        Interview explanation:
        Among boxes that can hold itemSize, pick the smallest capacity; ties →
        smallest index.

        Algorithm:
        - Track best (capacity, index) among capacity[i] >= itemSize.
        - Return that index, or -1 if none.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.
