#
#
# There is a garden of n flowers, and each flower has an integer beauty
# value. The flowers are arranged in a line. You are given an integer
# array flowers of size n and each flowers[i] represents the beauty of the
# i^th flower.
#
#
#
# A garden is valid if it meets these conditions:
#
#
#
#
#
# The garden has at least two flowers.
#
#
# The first and the last flower of the garden have the same beauty value.
#
#
#
#
#
# As the appointed gardener, you have the ability to remove any (possibly
# none) flowers from the garden. You want to remove flowers in a way that
# makes the remaining garden valid. The beauty of the garden is the sum of
# the beauty of all the remaining flowers.
#
#
#
# Return the maximum possible beauty of some valid garden after you have
# removed any (possibly none) flowers.
#
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: flowers = [1,2,3,1,2]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: You can produce the valid garden [2,3,1,2] to have a total
# beauty of 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 8.
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
#
#
# Input: flowers = [100,1,1,-3,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You can produce the valid garden [1,1,1] to have a total
# beauty of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
#
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
#
#
# Input: flowers = [-1,-2,0,-1]
# Output: -2
# Explanation: You can produce the valid garden [-1,-1] to have a total
# beauty of -1 + -1 = -2.
#
#
#
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
#
#
#
# 2 <= flowers.length <= 10^5
#
#
# -10^4 <= flowers[i] <= 10^4
#
#
# It is possible to create a valid garden by removing some (possibly none)
# flowers.

        Interview explanation:
        Premium: valid garden = remaining flowers with equal first/last beauty.
        Ends must stay; middle flowers may be removed → keep only positive
        middle values. For each value v appearing ≥2 times, optimal ends are
        its first and last index.
