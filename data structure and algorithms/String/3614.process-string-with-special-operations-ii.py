# Testcase Example:  "\"a#b%*\"\n1"
#
#
# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and the
# special characters: '*', '#', and '%'.
#
# You are also given an integer k.
#
# Build a new string result by processing s according to the following
# rules from left to right:
#
# If the letter is a lowercase English letter append it to result.
#
# A '*' removes the last character from result, if it exists.
#
# A '#' duplicates the current result and appends it to itself.
#
# A '%' reverses the current result.
#
# Return the k^th character of the final string result. If k is out of the
# bounds of result, return '.'.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "a#b%*", k = 1
#
# Output: "a"

#                         Remove the last character
#                         "ba"
#
# The final result is "ba". The character at index k = 1 is 'a'.

# The final result is "". Since index k = 0 is out of bounds, the output
# is '.'.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
#
# s consists of only lowercase English letters and special characters '*',
# '#', and '%'.
#
# 0 <= k <= 10^15
#
# The length of result after processing s will not exceed 10^15.

        Interview explanation:
        Same ops as I, but result length can be 1e15 — cannot build it.
        Track length forward, then map index k backward through ops.

        Algorithm:
        - Forward: letter +1, '*' max(0,l-1), '#' l*=2, '%' no length change.
        - If k ≥ final length → '.'.
        - Reverse: undo '*'/ '#' / '%' on (length, k); on a letter, if k hits
          that position return it.

        Complexity: O(|s|) time, O(1) space.
