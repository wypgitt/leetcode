#
# There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and
# rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n -
# 1, where edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] indicates that there is an edge between
# nodes a_i and b_i in the tree.
#
# You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where
# values[i] is the value associated with the i^th node.
#
# You start with a score of 0. In one operation, you can:
#
# Pick any node i.
#
# Add values[i] to your score.
#
# Set values[i] to 0.
#
# A tree is healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any
# leaf node is different than zero.
#
# Return the maximum score you can obtain after performing these
# operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains healthy.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]
# Output: 11
# Explanation: We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the
# root is non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to
# any leaf is different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the
# score is values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.
# It can be shown that 11 is the maximum score obtainable after any number
# of operations on the tree.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values =
# [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]
# Output: 40
# Explanation: We can choose nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
# - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 4 is equal to 10.
# - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
# - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
# - The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
# Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] +
# values[3] + values[4] = 40.
# It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number
# of operations on the tree.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
#
# edges.length == n - 1
#
# edges[i].length == 2
#
# 0 <= a_i, b_i < n
#
# values.length == n
#
# 1 <= values[i] <= 10^9
#
# The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

        Interview explanation:
        Keep the tree healthy: every root-to-leaf path sum > 0. Maximize taken
        values = total - minimum values we must leave on the tree.

        Algorithm:
        - DFS: for leaf, must keep values[u]. Else keep min(values[u], sum of
          children's keep-costs) — either leave this node or leave enough in each child.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.
