#
# There exists an undirected tree with n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1. You
# are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where
# edges[i] = [u_i, v_i] indicates that there is an edge between nodes u_i
# and v_i in the tree. You are also given a positive integer k, and a
# 0-indexed array of non-negative integers nums of length n, where nums[i]
# represents the value of the node numbered i.
#
# Alice wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be maximum, for which
# Alice can perform the following operation any number of times (including
# zero) on the tree:
#
# Choose any edge [u, v] connecting the nodes u and v, and update their
# values as follows:
#
# nums[u] = nums[u] XOR k
#
# nums[v] = nums[v] XOR k
#
# Return the maximum possible sum of the values Alice can achieve by
# performing the operation any number of times.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,1], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 6 using a single
# operation:
# - Choose the edge [0,2]. nums[0] and nums[2] become: 1 XOR 3 = 2, and
# the array nums becomes: [1,2,1] -> [2,2,2].
# The total sum of values is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
# It can be shown that 6 is the maximum achievable sum of values.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [2,3], k = 7, edges = [[0,1]]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 9 using a single
# operation:
# - Choose the edge [0,1]. nums[0] becomes: 2 XOR 7 = 5 and nums[1]
# become: 3 XOR 7 = 4, and the array nums becomes: [2,3] -> [5,4].
# The total sum of values is 5 + 4 = 9.
# It can be shown that 9 is the maximum achievable sum of values.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7], k = 3, edges =
# [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]]
# Output: 42
# Explanation: The maximum achievable sum is 42 which can be achieved by
# Alice performing no operations.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n == nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
#
# 1 <= k <= 10^9
#
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
#
# edges.length == n - 1
#
# edges[i].length == 2
#
# 0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1
#
# The input is generated such that edges represent a valid tree.

        Interview explanation:
        XORing endpoints of an edge is like flipping two nodes by k. On a tree
        any even-sized subset can be flipped. Maximize sum under even flip count.

        Algorithm:
        - For each node take max(nums[i], nums[i]^k). If an odd number of nodes
          prefer the XOR form, undo the flip with the smallest |delta|.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.

        Alternate: start from original sum; sort per-node XOR deltas descending;

        Algorithm:
        - deltas[i] = (nums[i]^k) - nums[i]; sort desc; greedily pair takes.
