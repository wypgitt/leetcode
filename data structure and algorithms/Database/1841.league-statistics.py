# Table: Teams
#
# +----------------+---------+
# | Column Name    | Type    |
# +----------------+---------+
# | team_id        | int     |
# | team_name      | varchar |
# +----------------+---------+
# team_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# Each row contains information about one team in the league.
#
# Table: Matches
#
# +-----------------+---------+
# | Column Name     | Type    |
# +-----------------+---------+
# | home_team_id    | int     |
# | away_team_id    | int     |
# | home_team_goals | int     |
# | away_team_goals | int     |
# +-----------------+---------+
# (home_team_id, away_team_id) is the primary key (combination of columns
# with unique values) for this table.
# Each row contains information about one match.
# home_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the home team.
# away_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the away team.
# The winner of the match is the team with the higher number of goals.
#
# Write a solution to report the statistics of the league. The statistics
# should be built using the played matches where the winning team gets
# three points and the losing team gets no points. If a match ends with a
# draw, both teams get one point.
#
# Each row of the result table should contain:
#
# team_name - The name of the team in the Teams table.
#
# matches_played - The number of matches played as either a home or away
# team.
#
# points - The total points the team has so far.
#
# goal_for - The total number of goals scored by the team across all
# matches.
#
# goal_against - The total number of goals scored by opponent teams
# against this team across all matches.
#
# goal_diff - The result of goal_for - goal_against.
#
# Return the result table ordered by points in descending order. If two or
# more teams have the same points, order them by goal_diff in descending
# order. If there is still a tie, order them by team_name in
# lexicographical order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Teams table:
# +---------+-----------+
# | team_id | team_name |
# +---------+-----------+
# | 1       | Ajax      |
# | 4       | Dortmund  |
# | 6       | Arsenal   |
# +---------+-----------+
# Matches table:
# +--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
# | home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |
# +--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
# | 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |
# | 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |
# | 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |
# | 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |
# +--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
# Output:
# +-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
# | team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against |
# goal_diff |
# +-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
# | Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4
# |
# | Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0
# |
# | Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4

# +-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
# Explanation:
# Ajax (team_id=1) played 4 matches: 2 losses and 2 draws. Total points =
# 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
# Dortmund (team_id=4) played 2 matches: 2 wins. Total points = 3 + 3 = 6.
# Arsenal (team_id=6) played 2 matches: 2 draws. Total points = 1 + 1 = 2.
# Dortmund is the first team in the table. Ajax and Arsenal have the same
# points, but since Arsenal has a higher goal_diff than Ajax, Arsenal
# comes before Ajax in the table.
