# Table: Candidates
#
# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | employee_id | int  |
# | experience  | enum |
# | salary      | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# experience is an ENUM (category) of types ('Senior', 'Junior').
# Each row of this table indicates the id of a candidate, their monthly
# salary, and their experience.
# The salary of each candidate is guaranteed to be unique.
#
# A company wants to hire new employees. The budget of the company for the
# salaries is $70000. The company's criteria for hiring are:
#
# Keep hiring the senior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire
# any more seniors.
#
# Use the remaining budget to hire the junior with the smallest salary.
#
# Keep hiring the junior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire
# any more juniors.
#
# Write a solution to find the ids of seniors and juniors hired under the
# mentioned criteria.
#
# Return the result table in any order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Candidates table:
# +-------------+------------+--------+
# | employee_id | experience | salary |
# +-------------+------------+--------+
# | 1           | Junior     | 10000  |
# | 9           | Junior     | 15000  |
# | 2           | Senior     | 20000  |
# | 11          | Senior     | 16000  |
# | 13          | Senior     | 50000  |
# | 4           | Junior     | 40000  |
# +-------------+------------+--------+
# Output:
# +-------------+
# | employee_id |
# +-------------+
# | 11          |
# | 2           |
# | 1           |
# | 9           |
# +-------------+
# Explanation:
# We can hire 2 seniors with IDs (11, 2). Since the budget is $70000 and
# the sum of their salaries is $36000, we still have $34000 but they are
# not enough to hire the senior candidate with ID 13.
# We can hire 2 juniors with IDs (1, 9). Since the remaining budget is
# $34000 and the sum of their salaries is $25000, we still have $9000 but
# they are not enough to hire the junior candidate with ID 4.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# Candidates table:
# +-------------+------------+--------+
# | employee_id | experience | salary |
# +-------------+------------+--------+
# | 1           | Junior     | 25000  |
# | 9           | Junior     | 10000  |
# | 2           | Senior     | 85000  |
# | 11          | Senior     | 80000  |
# | 13          | Senior     | 90000  |
# | 4           | Junior     | 30000  |
# +-------------+------------+--------+
# Output:
# +-------------+
# | employee_id |
# +-------------+
# | 9           |
# | 1           |
# | 4           |
# +-------------+
# Explanation:
# We cannot hire any seniors with the current budget as we need at least
# $80000 to hire one senior.
# We can hire all three juniors with the remaining budget.
