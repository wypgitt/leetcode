# Table: Orders
#
# +---------------+---------+
# | Column Name   | Type    |
# +---------------+---------+
# | order_id      | int     |
# | order_date    | date    |
# | customer_id   | int     |
# | invoice       | int     |
# +---------------+---------+
# order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
#
# Write a solution to find the number of unique orders and the number of
# unique customers with invoices > $20 for each different month.
#
# Return the result table sorted in any order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Orders table:
# +----------+------------+-------------+------------+
# | order_id | order_date | customer_id | invoice    |
# +----------+------------+-------------+------------+
# | 1        | 2020-09-15 | 1           | 30         |
# | 2        | 2020-09-17 | 2           | 90         |
# | 3        | 2020-10-06 | 3           | 20         |
# | 4        | 2020-10-20 | 3           | 21         |
# | 5        | 2020-11-10 | 1           | 10         |

# Explanation:
# In September 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers with
# invoices > $20.
# In October 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer, and only one of the
# two orders has invoice > $20.
# In November 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers but
# invoices < $20, so we don't include that month.
# In December 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer both with invoices >
# $20.
# In January 2021 we have two orders from 2 different customers, but only
# one of them with invoice > $20.

        Interview explanation:
        Premium SQL. Orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id, invoice).
        For months with invoice > 20: report month (YYYY-MM), unique order
        count, unique customer count.

        Algorithm:
        - WHERE invoice > 20; GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date,'%Y-%m');
          COUNT(order_id), COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id).

        Complexity: O(N) aggregation.
