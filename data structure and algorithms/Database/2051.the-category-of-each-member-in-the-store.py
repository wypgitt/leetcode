# Table: Members
#
# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | member_id   | int     |
# | name        | varchar |
# +-------------+---------+
# member_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a member.
#
# Table: Visits
#
# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | visit_id    | int  |
# | member_id   | int  |
# | visit_date  | date |
# +-------------+------+
# visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# member_id is a foreign key (reference column) to member_id from the
# Members table.
# Each row of this table contains information about the date of a visit to
# the store and the member who visited it.
#
# Table: Purchases
#
# +----------------+------+
# | Column Name    | Type |
# +----------------+------+
# | visit_id       | int  |
# | charged_amount | int  |
# +----------------+------+
# visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# visit_id is a foreign key (reference column) to visit_id from the Visits
# table.
# Each row of this table contains information about the amount charged in
# a visit to the store.
#
# A store wants to categorize its members. There are three tiers:
#
# "Diamond": if the conversion rate is greater than or equal to 80.
#
# "Gold": if the conversion rate is greater than or equal to 50 and less
# than 80.
#
# "Silver": if the conversion rate is less than 50.
#
# "Bronze": if the member never visited the store.
#
# The conversion rate of a member is (100 * total number of purchases for
# the member) / total number of visits for the member.
#
# Write a solution to report the id, the name, and the category of each
# member.
#
# Return the result table in any order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Members table:
# +-----------+---------+
# | member_id | name    |
# +-----------+---------+
# | 9         | Alice   |
# | 11        | Bob     |
# | 3         | Winston |
# | 8         | Hercy   |
# | 1         | Narihan |
# +-----------+---------+
# Visits table:
# +----------+-----------+------------+
# | visit_id | member_id | visit_date |
# +----------+-----------+------------+
# | 22       | 11        | 2021-10-28 |
# | 16       | 11        | 2021-01-12 |

# | 19       | 3         | 2021-10-19 |
# | 12       | 11        | 2021-03-01 |
# | 17       | 8         | 2021-05-07 |
# | 21       | 9         | 2021-05-12 |
# +----------+-----------+------------+
# Purchases table:
# +----------+----------------+
# | visit_id | charged_amount |
# +----------+----------------+
# | 12       | 2000           |
# | 18       | 9000           |
# | 17       | 7000           |
# +----------+----------------+
# Output:
# +-----------+---------+----------+
# | member_id | name    | category |
# +-----------+---------+----------+
# | 1         | Narihan | Bronze   |
# | 3         | Winston | Silver   |
# | 8         | Hercy   | Diamond  |
# | 9         | Alice   | Gold     |
# | 11        | Bob     | Silver   |
# +-----------+---------+----------+
# Explanation:
# - User Narihan with id = 1 did not make any visits to the store. She
# gets a Bronze category.
# - User Winston with id = 3 visited the store one time and did not
# purchase anything. The conversion rate = (100 * 0) / 1 = 0. He gets a
# Silver category.
# - User Hercy with id = 8 visited the store one time and purchased one
# time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 1 = 1. He gets a Diamond
# category.
# - User Alice with id = 9 visited the store two times and purchased one
# time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 2 = 50. She gets a Gold
# category.
# - User Bob with id = 11 visited the store three times and purchased one
# time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 3 = 33.33. He gets a Silver
# category.
