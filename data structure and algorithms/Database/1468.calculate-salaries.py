# Table Salaries:
#
# +---------------+---------+
# | Column Name   | Type    |
# +---------------+---------+
# | company_id    | int     |
# | employee_id   | int     |
# | employee_name | varchar |
# | salary        | int     |
# +---------------+---------+
# In SQL,(company_id, employee_id) is the primary key for this table.
# This table contains the company id, the id, the name, and the salary for
# an employee.
#
# Find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes. Round the
# salary to the nearest integer.
#
# The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following
# criteria:
#
# 0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than $1000.
#
# 24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range
# [1000, 10000] inclusive.
#
# 49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than
# $10000.
#
# Return the result table in any order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Salaries table:
# +------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
# | company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |
# +------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
# | 1          | 1           | Tony          | 2000   |
# | 1          | 2           | Pronub        | 21300  |
# | 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 10800  |
# | 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |
# | 2          | 7           | Bassem        | 450    |
# | 2          | 9           | Hermione      | 700    |
# | 3          | 7           | Bocaben       | 100    |
# | 3          | 2           | Ognjen        | 2200   |
# | 3          | 13          | Nyancat       | 3300   |
# | 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 7777   |

# Output:

# | company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |

# | 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 5508   |
# | 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |

# | 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 5911   |
# +------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
# Explanation:
# For company 1, Max salary is 21300. Employees in company 1 have taxes =
# 49%
# For company 2, Max salary is 700. Employees in company 2 have taxes = 0%
# For company 3, Max salary is 7777. Employees in company 3 have taxes =
# 24%
# The salary after taxes = salary - (taxes percentage / 100) * salary
# For example, Salary for Morninngcat (3, 15) after taxes = 7777 - 7777 *
# (24 / 100) = 7777 - 1866.48 = 5910.52, which is rounded to 5911.
