# Table: Products
#
# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | product_id  | int     |
# | store       | varchar |
# | price       | int     |
# +-------------+---------+
# (product_id, store) is the primary key (combination of columns with
# unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table indicates the price of product_id in store.
# There will be at most 30 different stores in the table.
# price is the price of the product at this store.
#
# Important note: This problem targets those who have a good experience
# with SQL. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you skip it for now.
#
# Implement the procedure PivotProducts to reorganize the Products table
# so that each row has the id of one product and its price in each store.
# The price should be null if the product is not sold in a store. The
# columns of the table should contain each store and they should be sorted
# in lexicographical order.
#
# The procedure should return the table after reorganizing it.
#
# Return the result table in any order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Products table:
# +------------+----------+-------+
# | product_id | store    | price |
# +------------+----------+-------+
# | 1          | Shop     | 110   |
# | 1          | LC_Store | 100   |
# | 2          | Nozama   | 200   |
# | 2          | Souq     | 190   |
# | 3          | Shop     | 1000  |
# | 3          | Souq     | 1900  |
# +------------+----------+-------+
# Output:
# +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
# | product_id | LC_Store | Nozama | Shop | Souq |
# +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
# | 1          | 100      | null   | 110  | null |
# | 2          | null     | 200    | null | 190  |
# | 3          | null     | null   | 1000 | 1900 |
# +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
# Explanation:
# We have 4 stores: Shop, LC_Store, Nozama, and Souq. We first order them
# lexicographically to be: LC_Store, Nozama, Shop, and Souq.
# Now, for product 1, the price in LC_Store is 100 and in Shop is 110. For
# the other two stores, the product is not sold so we set the price as
# null.
# Similarly, product 2 has a price of 200 in Nozama and 190 in Souq. It is
# not sold in the other two stores.
# For product 3, the price is 1000 in Shop and 1900 in Souq. It is not
# sold in the other two stores.

        Interview explanation:
        SQL procedure PivotProducts: pivot Products(product_id, store, price) so
        each store is a column (lexicographic), NULL if not sold.

        Algorithm:
        - Dynamic SQL via GROUP_CONCAT of CASE expressions; PREPARE/EXECUTE.

        Complexity: O(N * S), S=#stores <= 30.
