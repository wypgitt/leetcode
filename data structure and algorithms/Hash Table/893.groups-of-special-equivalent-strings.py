# Testcase Example:  "[\"abcd\",\"cdab\",\"cbad\",\"xyzz\",\"zzxy\",\"zzyx\"]"
#
# You are given an array of strings of the same length words.
#
# In one move, you can swap any two even indexed characters or any two odd
# indexed characters of a string words[i].
#
# Two strings words[i] and words[j] are special-equivalent if after any number
# of moves, words[i] == words[j].
#
# For example, words[i] = "zzxy" and words[j] = "xyzz" are special-equivalent
# because we may make the moves "zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz".
#
# A group of special-equivalent strings from words is a non-empty subset of
# words such that:
#
# Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and
#
# The group is the largest size possible (i.e., there is not a string words[i]
# not in the group such that words[i] is special-equivalent to every string in
# the group).
#
# Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from words.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: words = ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# One group is ["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"], since they are all pairwise special
# equivalent, and none of the other strings is all pairwise special equivalent
# to these.
# The other two groups are ["xyzz", "zzxy"] and ["zzyx"].
# Note that in particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: words = ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
# Output: 3
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= words.length <= 1000
#
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
#
# words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
#
# All the strings are of the same length.

        Interview explanation:
        Special-equivalent: can rearrange even indices among themselves and
        odd among themselves. Signature = sorted even chars + sorted odd chars.

        Algorithm:
        - For each word, key=(sorted even, sorted odd); count unique keys.

        Complexity: O(N * L log L) time, O(N*L) space.
