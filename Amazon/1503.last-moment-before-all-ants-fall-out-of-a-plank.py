#
# We have a wooden plank of the length n units. Some ants are walking on the
# plank, each ant moves with a speed of 1 unit per second. Some of the ants
# move to the left, the other move to the right.
#
# When two ants moving in two different directions meet at some point, they
# change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions
# does not take any additional time.
#
# When an ant reaches one end of the plank at a time t, it falls out of the
# plank immediately.
#
# Given an integer n and two integer arrays left and right, the positions of
# the ants moving to the left and the right, return the moment when the last
# ant(s) fall out of the plank.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 4, left = [4,3], right = [0,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: In the image above:
# -The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right.
# -The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.
# -The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.
# -The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.
# The last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 seconds. After that, it
# falls immediately out of the plank. (i.e., We can say that at t =
# 4.0000000001, there are no ants on the plank).
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 7, left = [], right = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: All ants are going to the right, the ant at index 0 needs 7
# seconds to fall.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: n = 7, left = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], right = []
# Output: 7
# Explanation: All ants are going to the left, the ant at index 7 needs 7
# seconds to fall.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 10^4
#
# 0 <= left.length <= n + 1
#
# 0 <= left[i] <= n
#
# 0 <= right.length <= n + 1
#
# 0 <= right[i] <= n
#
# 1 <= left.length + right.length <= n + 1
#
# All values of left and right are unique, and each value can appear only in
# one of the two arrays.

        Interview explanation:
        Ants bouncing exchange identities — equivalent to walking straight
        through. Last moment is the max distance any ant walks off the plank.

        Algorithm:
        - max over left ants of position; max over right ants of n-position.

        Complexity: O(L+R) time, O(1) space.
