#
#
# You are given an integer array nums, and an integer k. Let's introduce
# K-or operation by extending the standard bitwise OR. In K-or, a bit
# position in the result is set to 1 if at least k numbers in nums have a
# 1 in that position.
#
# Return the K-or of nums.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [7,12,9,8,9,15], k = 4
#
# Output: 9
#
# Explanation:
#
# Represent numbers in binary:
#
#                         Number
#                         Bit 3
#                         Bit 2
#                         Bit 1
#                         Bit 0
#
#                         7
#                         0
#                         1
#                         1
#                         1

#                         12
#                         1

#                         0
#                         0

#                         9
#                         1
#                         0
#                         0
#                         1
#
#                         8
#                         1
#                         0
#                         0
#                         0
#
#                         9
#                         1
#                         0
#                         0
#                         1
#
#                         15
#                         1
#                         1
#                         1
#                         1
#
#                         Result = 9
#                         1
#                         0
#                         0
#                         1
#
# Bit 0 is set in 7, 9, 9, and 15. Bit 3 is set in 12, 9, 8, 9, and 15.
#
# Only bits 0 and 3 qualify. The result is (1001)_2 = 9.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [2,12,1,11,4,5], k = 6
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation: No bit appears as 1 in all six array numbers, as required
# for K-or with k = 6. Thus, the result is 0.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [10,8,5,9,11,6,8], k = 1
#
# Output: 15
#
# Explanation:  Since k == 1, the 1-or of the array is equal to the
# bitwise OR of all its elements. Hence, the answer is 10 OR 8 OR 5 OR 9
# OR 11 OR 6 OR 8 = 15.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 50
#
# 0 <= nums[i] < 2^31
#
# 1 <= k <= nums.length

        - For each bit 0..31, count how many nums have it; OR into answer if >= k.
