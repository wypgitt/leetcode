# Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.
#
# The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all
# left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does
# not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is
# treated as 0. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2;
# right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
# Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
# Output: 15
# Explanation:
# Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3;
# right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
# Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just
# right child, so sum is 7)
# Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5,
# and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
# Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]
# Output: 9
#
# Constraints:
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
#
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

        Interview explanation:
        A node's tilt is |sum(left subtree) - sum(right subtree)|. The answer
        is the sum of tilts over all nodes. One postorder DFS returns subtree
        sums while accumulating tilts.

        Algorithm:
        - Recurse left/right to get subtree sums.
        - Add abs(left_sum - right_sum) to a global total.
        - Return node.val + left_sum + right_sum as this subtree's sum.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(h) recursion space.
