#
# You are given an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes numbered
# from 0 to n - 1, represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where
# edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, length_i] indicates an edge between nodes u_i and
# v_i with length length_i. You are also given an integer array nums,
# where nums[i] represents the value at node i.
#
# A special path is defined as a downward path from an ancestor node to a
# descendant node such that all the values of the nodes in that path are
# unique.
#
# Note that a path may start and end at the same node.
#
# Return an array result of size 2, where result[0] is the length of the
# longest special path, and result[1] is the minimum number of nodes in
# all possible longest special paths.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], nums =
# [2,1,2,1,3,1]
#
# Output: [6,2]
#
# Explanation:
#
# In the image below, nodes are colored by their corresponding values in
# nums
#
# The longest special paths are 2 -> 5 and 0 -> 1 -> 4, both having a
# length of 6. The minimum number of nodes across all longest special
# paths is 2.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: edges = [[1,0,8]], nums = [2,2]
#
# Output: [0,1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The longest special paths are 0 and 1, both having a length of 0. The
# minimum number of nodes across all longest special paths is 1.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
#
# edges.length == n - 1
#
# edges[i].length == 3
#
# 0 <= u_i, v_i < n
#
# 1 <= length_i <= 10^3
#
# nums.length == n
#
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4
#
# The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

        Interview explanation:
        Special paths are root-downward with distinct values. On the root-to-node
        path, keep a sliding left boundary that jumps past the previous occurrence
        of the current value so the active suffix has unique nums.

        Algorithm:
        - Build adjacency; DFS from 0 with prefix path lengths.
        - lastSeen[value] = depth index of prior occurrence; left = max(left, prev).
        - Path length = prefix[-1]-prefix[left]; nodes = len(prefix)-left.
        - Track max length and min nodes among ties; restore lastSeen on backtrack.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.
