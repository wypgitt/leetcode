# Testcase Example:  "10\n2"
#
# Given two positive integers n and x.
#
# Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the x^th power of
# unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique
# integers [n_1, n_2, ..., n_k] where n = n_1^x + n_2^x + ... + n_k^x.
#
# Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
#
# For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 2^3 + 3^3 +
# 5^3.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 10, x = 2
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We can express n as the following: n = 3^2 + 1^2 = 10.
# It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2^nd
# power of unique integers.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 4, x = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
# - n = 4^1 = 4.
# - n = 3^1 + 1^1 = 4.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= n <= 300
#
#
# 1 <= x <= 5
