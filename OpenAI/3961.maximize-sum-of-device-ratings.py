#
#
# You are given a 2D integer array units of size m × n where units[i][j]
# represents the capacity of the j^th unit in the i^th device. Each device
# contains exactly n units.
#
# The rating of a device is the minimum capacity among all its units.
#
# You may perform the following operation any number of times (including
# zero):
#
# Choose a device i that has not been used as a source before.
#
# Remove exactly one unit from device i and add it to any different
# device.
#
# Then mark device i as used, so it cannot be chosen again as a source.
#
# Return the maximum possible sum of the ratings of all devices after any
# number of such operations.
#
# Note:
#
# Devices can receive units from multiple devices, regardless of whether
# they have been selected.
#
# The rating of an empty device is 0.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: units = [[1,3],[2,2]]
#
# Output: 4
#
# Explanation:
#
# ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Select device i = 0 and transfer units[0][0] = 1 to device
# i = 1.
#
# After the transfer, the ratings are:
#
# Device 0 = [3]: rating[0] = 3
#
# Device 1 = [2, 2, 1]: rating[1] = 1
#
# Thus, the sum of ratings is 3 + 1 = 4.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: units = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
#
# Output: 6
#
# Explanation:
#
# Select device i = 1 and transfer units[1][0] = 4 to device i = 0.
#
# After the transfer, the ratings are:
#
# Device 0 = [1, 2, 3, 4]: rating[0] = 1
#
# Device 1 = [5, 6]: rating[1] = 5
#
# Thus, the sum of ratings is 1 + 5 = 6.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: units = [[5,5,5],[1,1,1]]
#
# Output: 6
#
# Explanation:
#
# No transfers increase the sum of ratings. Thus, the sum of ratings is 5
# + 1 = 6.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= m == units.length <= 10^5
#
# 1 <= n == units[i].length <= 10^5
#
# m * n <= 2 * 10^5
#
# 1 <= units[i][j] <= 10^5
#

        """
        Interview explanation:
        Rating is the min unit. Dumping every device's smallest unit into one
        sink lets every other device keep its second-smallest as rating; choose
        the sink that loses the least (smallest second-min).

        Algorithm:
        - If each device has one unit, sum them.
        - Else sum all second-mins, then subtract (min_second − global_min).

        Complexity: O(total units) time, O(1) extra space.
