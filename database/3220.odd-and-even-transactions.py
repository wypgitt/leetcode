# Table: transactions
#
# +------------------+------+
# | Column Name      | Type |
# +------------------+------+
# | transaction_id   | int  |
# | amount           | int  |
# | transaction_date | date |
# +------------------+------+
# The transactions_id column uniquely identifies each row in this table.
# Each row of this table contains the transaction id, amount and
# transaction date.
#
# Write a solution to find the sum of amounts for odd and even
# transactions for each day. If there are no odd or even transactions for
# a specific date, display as 0.
#
# Return the result table ordered by transaction_date in ascending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#
# transactions table:
#
# +----------------+--------+------------------+
# | transaction_id | amount | transaction_date |
# +----------------+--------+------------------+
# | 1              | 150    | 2024-07-01       |
# | 2              | 200    | 2024-07-01       |
# | 3              | 75     | 2024-07-01       |
# | 4              | 300    | 2024-07-02       |
# | 5              | 50     | 2024-07-02       |
# | 6              | 120    | 2024-07-03       |
# +----------------+--------+------------------+
#
# Output:
#
# +------------------+---------+----------+
# | transaction_date | odd_sum | even_sum |
# +------------------+---------+----------+
# | 2024-07-01       | 75      | 350      |
# | 2024-07-02       | 0       | 350      |
# | 2024-07-03       | 0       | 120      |
# +------------------+---------+----------+
#
# Explanation:
#
# For transaction dates:
#
# 2024-07-01:
#
# Sum of amounts for odd transactions: 75
#
# Sum of amounts for even transactions: 150 + 200 = 350
#
# 2024-07-02:
#
# Sum of amounts for odd transactions: 0
#
# Sum of amounts for even transactions: 300 + 50 = 350
#
# 2024-07-03:
#
# Sum of amounts for odd transactions: 0
#
# Sum of amounts for even transactions: 120
#
# Note: The output table is ordered by transaction_date in ascending
# order.

        Interview explanation:
        For each transaction_date, sum amounts that are odd vs even. Missing
        side should be 0. Order by date ascending.

        Algorithm:
        - GROUP BY transaction_date with conditional SUM(CASE WHEN amount%2 ...).

        Complexity: O(N).
