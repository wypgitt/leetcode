# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | flight_id   | int  |
# | capacity    | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# flight_id column contains distinct values.
# Each row of this table contains flight id and capacity.
#
# Table: Passengers
#
# +--------------+----------+
# | Column Name  | Type     |

# | passenger_id | int      |
# | flight_id    | int      |
# | booking_time | datetime |
# +--------------+----------+
# passenger_id column contains distinct values.
# booking_time column contains distinct values.
# Each row of this table contains passenger id, booking time, and their
# flight id.
#
# Passengers book tickets for flights in advance. If a passenger books a
# ticket for a flight and there are still empty seats available on the
# flight, the passenger's ticket will be confirmed. However, the passenger
# will be on a waitlist if the flight is already at full capacity.
#
# Write a solution to determine the current status of flight tickets for
# each passenger.
#
# Return the result table ordered by passenger_id in ascending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Flights table:
# +-----------+----------+
# | flight_id | capacity |
# +-----------+----------+
# | 1         | 2        |

# Explanation:
# - Flight 1 has a capacity of 2 passengers. Passenger 101 and Passenger
# 103 were the first to book tickets, securing the available seats.
# Therefore, their bookings are confirmed. However, Passenger 102 was the
# third person to book a ticket for this flight, which means there are no
# more available seats. Passenger 102 is now placed on the waitlist,
# - Flight 2 has a capacity of 2 passengers, Flight 2 has exactly two
# passengers who booked tickets,  Passenger 104 and Passenger 105. Since
# the number of passengers who booked tickets matches the available seats,
# both bookings are confirmed.
# - Flight 3 has a capacity of 1 passenger. Passenger 107 booked earlier
# and secured the only available seat, confirming their booking. Passenger
# 106, who booked after Passenger 107, is on the waitlist.
