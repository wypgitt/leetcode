# +--------------+---------+
# | Column Name  | Type    |
# +--------------+---------+
# | student_id   | int     |
# | student_name | varchar |
# | assignment1  | int     |
# | assignment2  | int     |

# student_id is column of unique values for this table.
# This table contains student_id, student_name, assignment1, assignment2,
# and assignment3.
#
# Write a solution to calculate the difference in the total score (sum of
# all 3 assignments) between the highest score obtained by students and
# the lowest score obtained by them.
#
# Return the result table in any order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.

# Explanation
# - student_id 309 has a total score of 88 + 47 + 87 = 222.
# - student_id 321 has a total score of 98 + 95 + 37 = 230.
# - student_id 338 has a total score of 100 + 64 + 43 = 207.
# - student_id 423 has a total score of 60 + 44 + 47 = 151.
# - student_id 896 has a total score of 32 + 37 + 50 = 119.
# - student_id 235 has a total score of 31 + 53 + 69 = 153.
# student_id 321 has the highest score of 230, while student_id 896 has
# the lowest score of 119. Therefore, the difference between them is 111.
