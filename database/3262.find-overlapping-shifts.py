# Table: EmployeeShifts

# +------------------+---------+
# | Column Name      | Type    |
# +------------------+---------+
# | employee_id      | int     |

# (employee_id, start_time) is the unique key for this table.
# This table contains information about the shifts worked by employees,
# including the start and end times on a specific date.
#
# Write a solution to count the number of overlapping shifts for each
# employee. Two shifts are considered overlapping if one shift’s end_time
# is later than another shift’s start_time.
#
# Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.
#
# The query result format is in the following example.

# Example:

# Input:
#
# EmployeeShifts table:

# | employee_id | start_time | end_time |

# Explanation:
#
# Employee 1 has 3 shifts:
#
# 08:00:00 to 12:00:00
#
# 11:00:00 to 15:00:00
#
# 14:00:00 to 18:00:00
#
#         The first shift overlaps with the second, and the second
# overlaps with the third, resulting in 2 overlapping shifts.
#
# Employee 2 has 2 shifts:
#
# 09:00:00 to 17:00:00
#
# 16:00:00 to 20:00:00
#
#         These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping
# shift.
#
# Employee 3 has 3 shifts:
#
# 10:00:00 to 12:00:00
#
# 13:00:00 to 15:00:00
#
# 16:00:00 to 18:00:00
#
#         None of these shifts overlap, so Employee 3 is not included in
# the output.
#
# Employee 4 has 2 shifts:
#
# 08:00:00 to 10:00:00
#
# 09:00:00 to 11:00:00
#
#         These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping
# shift.
#
# The output shows the employee_id and the count of overlapping shifts for
# each employee who has at least one overlapping shift, ordered by
# employee_id in ascending order.

        Interview explanation:
        Premium SQL: EmployeeShifts(employee_id, start_time, end_time). Count
        overlapping shift pairs per employee (end_time of one > start_time of
        another). Omit employees with zero overlaps; order by employee_id ASC.

        Algorithm:
        - Self-join same employee on a.start_time < b.start_time AND a.end_time > b.start_time.
        - GROUP BY employee_id; COUNT pairs.

        Complexity: O(N^2) worst-case joins; index-friendly on (employee_id, start_time).
