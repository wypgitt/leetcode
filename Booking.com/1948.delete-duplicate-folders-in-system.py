#
# Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are
# given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute
# path to the i^th folder in the file system.
#
# For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
#
# Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain
# the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder
# structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical.
# If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all
# their subfolders.
#
# For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical.
# They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
#
# /a
#
# /a/x
#
# /a/x/y
#
# /a/z
#
# /b
#
# /b/x
#
# /b/x/y
#
# /b/z
#
# However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the
# folders "/a" and "/b" would not be identical. Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x"
# would still be considered identical even with the added folder.
#
# Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the
# file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion
# once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not
# deleted.
#
# Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after
# deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
# Output: [["d"],["d","a"]]
# Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
# Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because
# they both contain an empty
# folder named "b".
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: paths =
# [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
# Output: [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
# Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
# Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion
# because they both contain an empty folder named "y".
# Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they
# are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
# Output: [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
# Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
# Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does
# not matter.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4
#
# 1 <= paths[i].length <= 500
#
# 1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10
#
# 1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 10^5
#
# path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
#
# No two paths lead to the same folder.
#
# For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the
# input.

        Interview explanation:
        Folder tree; two folders duplicate if same structure of subfolder names
        (serialized children). Delete all duplicates (and contents). Roots never
        deleted solely by empty serial — empty folders are identical only if both
        have no children; problem marks non-empty duplicate subtrees.

        Algorithm:
        - Build trie. Serialize each node's children map as sorted name(serial).
          Count serial frequencies; mark nodes whose serial appears >1 (and serial
          nonempty). DFS collect remaining paths.

        Complexity: O(N * L log L) for N nodes.
