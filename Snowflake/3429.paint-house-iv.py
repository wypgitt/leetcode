#
# You are given an even integer n representing the number of houses
# arranged in a straight line, and a 2D array cost of size n x 3, where
# cost[i][j] represents the cost of painting house i with color j + 1.
#
# The houses will look beautiful if they satisfy the following conditions:
#
# No two adjacent houses are painted the same color.
#
# Houses equidistant from the ends of the row are not painted the same
# color. For example, if n = 6, houses at positions (0, 5), (1, 4), and
# (2, 3) are considered equidistant.
#
# Return the minimum cost to paint the houses such that they look
# beautiful.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 4, cost = [[3,5,7],[6,2,9],[4,8,1],[7,3,5]]
#
# Output: 9
#
# Explanation:
#
# The optimal painting sequence is [1, 2, 3, 2] with corresponding costs
# [3, 2, 1, 3]. This satisfies the following conditions:
#
# No adjacent houses have the same color.
#
# Houses at positions 0 and 3 (equidistant from the ends) are not painted
# the same color (1 != 2).
#
# Houses at positions 1 and 2 (equidistant from the ends) are not painted
# the same color (2 != 3).
#
# The minimum cost to paint the houses so that they look beautiful is 3 +
# 2 + 1 + 3 = 9.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 6, cost = [[2,4,6],[5,3,8],[7,1,9],[4,6,2],[3,5,7],[8,2,4]]
#
# Output: 18
#
# Explanation:
#
# The optimal painting sequence is [1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2] with corresponding
# costs [2, 8, 1, 2, 3, 2]. This satisfies the following conditions:
#
# No adjacent houses have the same color.
#
# Houses at positions 0 and 5 (equidistant from the ends) are not painted
# the same color (1 != 2).
#
# Houses at positions 1 and 4 (equidistant from the ends) are not painted
# the same color (3 != 1).
#
# Houses at positions 2 and 3 (equidistant from the ends) are not painted
# the same color (2 != 3).
#
# The minimum cost to paint the houses so that they look beautiful is 2 +
# 8 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 18.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 10^5
#
# n is even.
#
# cost.length == n
#
# cost[i].length == 3
#
# 0 <= cost[i][j] <= 10^5

        Interview explanation:
        Pair houses (i, n-1-i). Paint both ends inward with DP on previous pair
        colors: adjacent houses differ, and each equidistant pair differs.

        Algorithm:
        - dp(i, prevL, prevR): min cost for pairs i..n/2-1 with previous colors.
        - Try colors cL != prevL, cR != prevR, cL != cR; add cost[i][cL] +
          cost[n-1-i][cR] and recurse.
        - Start with invalid prev colors (3).

        Complexity: O(n) time (O(1) color states), O(n) space with memo.
