# Testcase Example:  "[3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]"
#
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an
# equal number of positive and negative integers.
#
# You should return the array of nums such that the array follows the given
# conditions:
#
#
# Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
#
#
# For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in
# nums is preserved.
#
#
# The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
#
# Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the
# aforementioned conditions.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
# Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
# Explanation:
# The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are
# [-2,-5,-4].
# The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions
# is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
# Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are
# incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [-1,1]
# Output: [1,-1]
# Explanation:
# 1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
# So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5
#
#
# nums.length is even
#
#
# 1 <= |nums[i]| <= 10^5
#
#
# nums consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.
#
#
#
# It is not required to do the modifications in-place.

class Solution:
    def rearrangeArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Interview explanation:
        Rearrange so signs alternate starting with positive, preserving relative
        order of positives and of negatives.

        Algorithm:
        - Two pointers into result at even/odd indices for +/−.

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space.
