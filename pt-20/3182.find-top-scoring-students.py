# Explanation:
#
# Alice (student_id 1) is a Computer Science major and has taken both
# "Algorithms" and "Data Structures", receiving an 'A' in both.
#
# Bob (student_id 2) is a Computer Science major but did not receive an
# 'A' in all required courses.
#
# Charlie (student_id 3) is a Mathematics major and has taken both
# "Calculus" and "Linear Algebra", receiving an 'A' in both.
#
# David (student_id 4) is a Mathematics major but did not receive an 'A'
# in all required courses.
#
# Note: Output table is ordered by student_id in ascending order.
