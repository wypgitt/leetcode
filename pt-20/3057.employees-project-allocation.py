# Table: Project
#
# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | project_id  | int     |
# | employee_id | int     |
# | workload    | int     |
# +-------------+---------+
# employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this
# table.
# employee_id is a foreign key (reference column) to Employee table.
# Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is
# working on the project with project_id and the workload of the project.

# Table: Employees
#
# +------------------+---------+
# | Column Name      | Type    |
# +------------------+---------+
# | employee_id      | int     |
# | name             | varchar |
# | team             | varchar |
# +------------------+---------+
# employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this
# table.
# Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
#
# Write a solution to find the employees who are allocated to projects
# with a workload that exceeds the average workload of all employees for
# their respective teams
#
# Return the result table ordered by employee_id, project_id in ascending
# order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# Project table:
# +-------------+-------------+----------+
# | project_id  | employee_id | workload |
# +-------------+-------------+----------+
# | 1           | 1           |  45      |
# | 1           | 2           |  90      |
# | 2           | 3           |  12      |
# | 2           | 4           |  68      |
# +-------------+-------------+----------+
# Employees table:
# +-------------+--------+------+
# | employee_id | name   | team |
# +-------------+--------+------+
# | 1           | Khaled | A    |
# | 2           | Ali    | B    |
# | 3           | John   | B    |
# | 4           | Doe    | A    |
# +-------------+--------+------+
# Output:
# +-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
# | employee_id | project_id | employee_name | project_workload |
# +-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
# | 2           | 1          | Ali           | 90               |
# | 4           | 2          | Doe           | 68               |
# +-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
# Explanation:
# - Employee with ID 1 has a project workload of 45 and belongs to Team A,
# where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does not
# exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
# - Employee with ID 2 has a project workload of 90 and belongs to Team B,
# where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does
# exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.
# - Employee with ID 3 has a project workload of 12 and belongs to Team B,
# where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does not
# exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
# - Employee with ID 4 has a project workload of 68 and belongs to Team A,
# where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does
# exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.
# Result table orderd by employee_id, project_id in ascending order.
