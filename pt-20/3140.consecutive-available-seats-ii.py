# Table: Cinema
#
# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | seat_id     | int  |
# | free        | bool |
# +-------------+------+
# seat_id is an auto-increment column for this table.
# Each row of this table indicates whether the i^th seat is free or not. 1
# means free while 0 means occupied.
#
# Write a solution to find the length of longest consecutive sequence of
# available seats in the cinema.
#
# Note:
#
# There will always be at most one longest consecutive sequence.
#
# If there are multiple consecutive sequences with the same length,
# include all of them in the output.
#
# Return the result table ordered by first_seat_id in ascending order.
#
# The result format is in the following example.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#
# Cinema table:
#
# +---------+------+
# | seat_id | free |
# +---------+------+
# | 1       | 1    |
# | 2       | 0    |
# | 3       | 1    |
# | 4       | 1    |
# | 5       | 1    |
# +---------+------+
#
# Output:
#
# +-----------------+----------------+-----------------------+
# | first_seat_id   | last_seat_id   | consecutive_seats_len |
# +-----------------+----------------+-----------------------+
# | 3               | 5              | 3                     |
# +-----------------+----------------+-----------------------+
#
# Explanation:
#
# Longest consecutive sequence of available seats starts from seat 3 and
# ends at seat 5 with a length of 3.
#
# Output table is ordered by first_seat_id in ascending order.
