#
#
# You are given two non-negative integers n and s.
#
# Return the largest integer that has at most n digits and whose sum of
# digits is s. If no such integer exists, return -1.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 2, s = 9
#
# Output: 90
#
# Explanation:
#
# The largest integer with at most 2 digits that has a sum of digits of 9
# is 90.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: n = 2, s = 19
#
# Output: -1
#
# Explanation:
#
# There is no integer with at most 2 digits that has a sum of digits of
# 19, so the answer is -1.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: n = 5, s = 0
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# The only non-negative integer whose digits sum to 0 is 0.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 5
#
# 0 <= s <= 100

        Interview explanation:
        Largest integer with at most n digits and digit sum s. Impossible if
        s > 9n. Use n digits greedily from the high place (9s then remainder),
        except s == 0 which is just 0.

        Algorithm:
        - If s > 9*n: return -1.
        - Build the number left to right: digit = min(9, remaining sum).

        Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.
