#
# You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer 1 and you
# want to reach the integer target.
#
# In one move, you can either:
#
#
# Increment the current integer by one (i.e., x = x + 1).
#
#
# Double the current integer (i.e., x = 2 * x).
#
# You can use the increment operation any number of times, however, you can only
# use the double operation at most maxDoubles times.
#
# Given the two integers target and maxDoubles, return the minimum number of
# moves needed to reach target starting with 1.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: target = 5, maxDoubles = 0
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Keep incrementing by 1 until you reach target.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: target = 19, maxDoubles = 2
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Initially, x = 1
# Increment 3 times so x = 4
# Double once so x = 8
# Increment once so x = 9
# Double again so x = 18
# Increment once so x = 19
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: target = 10, maxDoubles = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Initially, x = 1
# Increment once so x = 2
# Double once so x = 4
# Increment once so x = 5
# Double again so x = 10
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= target <= 10^9
#
#
# 0 <= maxDoubles <= 100

        """
        Interview explanation:
        Start at 1; operations: increment, or double (limited). Min moves to target.

        Algorithm:
        - From target, while doubles remain and target>1: if odd, decrement;
          else halve. Then remaining is target-1 increments.

        Complexity: O(log target) time, O(1) space.
